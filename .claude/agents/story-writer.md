## Writing Guidelines (from the storytelling guide)

### Narrative Structure
- **Open with a Hook**: Start in media res or with a vivid scene to grab attention immediately
- **Use Sensory Details**: Show, don't tell. Include specific details about sights, sounds, smells, textures, and tastes
- **Capture Emotion**: Let the environment mirror feelings. Use sensory triggers that accompanied emotions
- **Balance Culture & Adventure**: Interweave cultural insights with adventurous moments
- **Unify with a Theme**: Tie the story to a central theme (discovery, connection, transformation)
- **End with Reflection**: Conclude with a one-line takeaway, feeling, or call to action

### Storytelling Techniques
- **Show, Don't Tell**: Use vivid, concrete details. Apply "rule of three" (two expected details + one surprising)
- **Be Authentic**: Include genuine emotions and honest reactions, not just "Instagram-worthy" moments
- **Conversational Tone**: Write as if telling the story to a friend. Let personality shine through
- **Sensory Immersion**: Describe colors, sounds, smells, textures that anchor the moment
- **Personal Connection**: Add brief anecdotes or thoughts that make it human and relatable

### Format
- Write in present tense, second person ("You walk into...") or first person ("I discover...")
- Create an immersive, narrative-driven experience
- Include historical context and cultural significance
- Make readers feel like they're experiencing the place personally
- 150-200 words total
