---

# Social Media Adapter

Break down travel video scripts into engaging social media content across multiple platforms while maintaining Lilia's raw, authentic voice.

---

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- User wants to repurpose a video script for social media
- User requests Twitter/X threads from a story
- User needs Instagram carousel content
- User asks for Instagram post captions
- User mentions "social media", "Twitter thread", "Instagram post", "carousel"
- User wants to maximize reach across platforms

---

## Workflow

### STEP 1: Load Persona & Script

**MANDATORY - Load Lilia's persona first**:
```
view references/persona-to-adopt-improved.md
```

**Read the script**:
- User provides script path (e.g., `dist/georgia/gonio-fortress/2025-11-04/script.md`)
- Read and analyze the complete narrative
- Identify key story beats, emotional arc, and transformation

**Extract core elements**:
1. **Hook/Opening** - The attention-grabbing moment
2. **Key Story Beats** - 5-8 pivotal moments in the narrative
3. **Emotional Transformation** - How Lilia's perspective changed
4. **Surprising Discoveries** - Unexpected revelations or "wait, what?" moments
5. **Practical Insights** - Budget tips, timing, what to know
6. **Visual Moments** - Highly visual/photogenic beats
7. **Closing Reflection** - The final takeaway or transformation

---

### STEP 2: Analyze Platform Requirements

**Platform Specifications**:

| Platform | Format | Constraints | Best Practices |
|----------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Twitter/X Thread** | Text tweets | 280 chars/tweet | Start with hook tweet, 5-10 tweets total, use line breaks for emphasis, end with CTA |
| **Instagram Carousel** | 10 slides max | Text-on-image slides | Each slide = 1 key point, visual hierarchy, readable from thumbnail, save best for slides 8-10 |
| **Instagram Caption** | Single post | 2200 chars (but first 125 visible) | Hook in first line, line breaks for readability, 3-5 hashtags max, CTA at end |

**Content Adaptation Rules**:
- **Shorten ruthlessly** - Keep only the most impactful moments
- **Front-load emotion** - Platform algorithms favor fast engagement
- **Maintain voice** - Lilia's raw, conversational style must remain
- **Visual thinking** - Assume user will pair with photos/video clips
- **Standalone value** - Each piece must work independently (not everyone saw the video)

---

### STEP 3: Generate Twitter/X Thread

**Thread Structure** (5-10 tweets):

1. **Tweet 1 (Hook)** - Open with the most emotionally compelling line from the script
   - Start mid-thought or mid-emotion
   - Create curiosity gap
   - Promise transformation or surprise
   - Max 240 chars (leave room for thread indicators)

2. **Tweets 2-3 (Setup)** - Quick context
   - Where you are, why you went
   - Initial expectations or skepticism
   - Set the scene briefly

3. **Tweets 4-7 (Journey Beats)** - Key story moments
   - Each tweet = 1 pivotal beat
   - Include sensory details
   - Show emotional progression
   - Use line breaks for emphasis
   - Add vulnerable/surprising moments

4. **Tweet 8-9 (Climax/Revelation)** - The "aha" moment
   - The transformation or discovery
   - Most powerful emotional beat
   - Specific and visual

5. **Tweet 10 (Reflection + CTA)** - Close with insight
   - What this taught you
   - Universal takeaway
   - CTA: "Full story in my latest video (link in bio)" or "Have you been here? What did you feel?"

**Thread Formatting Rules**:
- Use line breaks for dramatic pauses
- Short sentences for impact
- Conversational asides in parentheses
- Natural use of "..." for trailing thoughts
- Tweet numbers if helpful (1/10, 2/10) but not required
- No hashtags mid-thread (only in final tweet if needed)

**Example Thread Format**:

```
Tweet 1:
I thought it was just another fortress.
Old stones. Tourist trap. Whatever.

Then I touched the wall and felt 2000 years of history in my fingertips.

Thread about why Gonio Fortress broke me 👇

---

Tweet 2:
Context: I'm in Georgia (the country, not the state).

My friend drags me to this Roman fortress. I'm skeptical. I've seen fortresses. They're fine.

I was so wrong.

---

Tweet 3:
The stones are massive. Like, how-did-they-even-move-these massive.

And they're WARM. The sun heats them all day.

I put my hand on one and just... stood there.

---

[Continue through revelation and closing]
```

---

### STEP 4: Generate Instagram Carousel (10 Slides)

**Carousel Slide Structure**:

Each slide must:
- Communicate ONE clear idea
- Be readable as a thumbnail (text not too small)
- Follow visual hierarchy (headline → detail → insight)
- Build narrative momentum across slides
- Save strongest content for slides 8-10 (engagement hack)

**Slide-by-Slide Breakdown**:

**Slide 1: Title/Hook**
- Large, bold headline (3-6 words)
- Subheadline with intrigue
- Visual: Most striking photo from the place
- Text example:
  ```
  "Just Old Stones"
  (That's what I thought)
  ```

**Slide 2: Setup/Expectation**
- What you expected going in
- Your initial skepticism or assumptions
- Visual: You arriving or exterior shot
- Text example:
  ```
  I thought: Another fortress
  Another tourist trap
  Another Instagram backdrop
  ```

**Slide 3-6: Journey Beats (4 slides)**
- Each slide = 1 key story moment
- Mix of discoveries, struggles, surprises
- Include sensory details and emotions
- Visual: Photos matching each beat
- Text examples:
  ```
  Slide 3:
  The stones are 2000 years old
  And they're warm from the sun
  I touched one and couldn't let go

  Slide 4:
  History isn't abstract here
  It's tangible. Physical.
  You can FEEL it.
  ```

**Slide 7: The Surprise/Challenge**
- Unexpected twist or difficult moment
- The thing that changed your perspective
- Visual: The surprising element
- Text example:
  ```
  I'm not spiritual
  I don't believe in "energy"

  But something shifted
  ```

**Slide 8: Emotional Climax**
- The peak revelation or feeling
- Most vulnerable moment
- Visual: Close-up, intimate shot
- Text example:
  ```
  For 20 minutes I just stood there
  Crying (not crying)
  Feeling the weight of everything
  That happened in this place
  ```

**Slide 9: Insight/Transformation**
- What this taught you
- How your perspective changed
- Universal takeaway
- Visual: Reflective shot (you looking out, sunset, etc.)
- Text example:
  ```
  Travel isn't about collecting places

  It's about moments like this
  Where history stops being a story
  And becomes REAL
  ```

**Slide 10: Call-to-Action**
- Invitation to engage
- Link to full video
- Question for audience
- Visual: Strong closing image
- Text example:
  ```
  📍 Gonio Fortress, Georgia

  Have you ever felt this?
  A place that changed you?

  Full story 👉 link in bio
  ```

**Design Notes for User**:
- Consistent color palette across all slides
- Font: Bold, readable (recommend sans-serif, 60pt+ for headlines)
- Contrast: Ensure text is readable on photos (use overlay/shadow)
- Minimal text per slide: 10-20 words max
- Tools: Canva, Adobe Express, or Instagram's native tools

---

### STEP 5: Generate Instagram Caption

**Caption Structure** (2200 char limit, but optimize for first 125):

**Line 1 (Hook - First 125 chars)**
- Must grab attention before "...more"
- Start with emotion or surprising statement
- Create curiosity gap
- Examples:
  - "I wasn't going to cry at a fortress. But here we are."
  - "Here's what nobody tells you about ancient places:"
  - "This fortress broke something open in me."

**Paragraph 1 (Setup - 2-3 lines)**
- Quick context
- Where, why, initial expectations
- Use line breaks for readability

**Paragraph 2-4 (Story Beats - 3-6 lines each)**
- Condense script's key moments
- Maintain Lilia's voice (raw, conversational, authentic)
- Include sensory details
- Show emotional progression
- Use line breaks between paragraphs

**Paragraph 5 (Climax/Revelation - 2-3 lines)**
- The transformation moment
- Most powerful emotional beat
- Vulnerable and specific

**Paragraph 6 (Reflection - 2-3 lines)**
- What this taught you
- Universal insight
- Honest, not preachy

**Final Lines (CTA + Location + Hashtags)**
- Question to audience
- Link to full video ("Full story 👉 link in bio")
- Location tag in text
- 3-5 relevant hashtags (no more - looks spammy)

**Caption Formatting Rules**:
- Use single line breaks between sentences for drama
- Double line breaks between paragraphs
- Emoji sparingly (1-2 max, only if natural)
- No ALL CAPS except for emphasis on 1-2 words
- Keep paragraphs short (2-4 lines max)

**Example Caption Format**:

```
I wasn't going to cry at a fortress. But here we are.

My friend dragged me to Gonio Fortress in Georgia. I was skeptical. I've seen fortresses. They're fine. Old stones, right?

Wrong.

The stones are 2000 years old and they're WARM. The sun heats them all day. I put my hand on one and I just... couldn't let go.

History stopped being abstract. It became physical. Tangible. Real.

I'm not spiritual. I don't believe in "energy" or whatever. But I stood there for 20 minutes with my hand on that wall and I felt everything. Every soldier who stood guard. Every person who walked through those gates. All of it.

And I cried. (I told you.)

Here's the thing: Travel isn't about collecting places. It's about these moments. When you stop performing for the camera and just... feel.

When history isn't a story anymore. It's just real.

Have you ever had a place do this to you? Just completely break you open?

## PLATFORM-SPECIFIC TACTICS

### Twitter/X
**Strengths:** Story-driven, encourages discussion
**Tactics:**
- Thread completion optimization: Strong hook + "wait for it" moments
- Reply to your own thread with outtakes/bonus thoughts
- Engage with travel community hashtags
- Retweet others' similar stories to build reciprocity

**Avoid:**
- Posting thread all at once (use scheduling tool for 5min intervals)
- Too many hashtags (looks spammy)
- Generic "link in bio" (be specific about what they'll find)

### Instagram Carousel
**Strengths:** Visual storytelling, high saves = algorithm boost
**Tactics:**
- Front-load intrigue in Slide 1 (thumbnail)
- Save best content for Slides 8-10 (engagement hack)
- Use text overlays strategically (not on every photo)
- Encourage "Save this for later" behavior

**Avoid:**
- All slides looking identical (visual monotony)
- Too much text (people won't read walls of text)
- Weak Slide 1 (won't swipe if not hooked)

### Instagram Caption
**Strengths:** Depth, authenticity, SEO-friendly
**Tactics:**
- First 125 characters must hook (before "...more")
- Use line breaks religiously (readability)
- Ask question at end (drives comments)
- Location tag + 3-5 hashtags (not more)

**Avoid:**
- Hashtag stuffing (max 5, relevant only)
- Generic CTA ("link in bio" alone - add context)
- No line breaks (looks like a wall of text)

## Key Principles

### 1. Voice Consistency Across Platforms
- Lilia's raw, authentic voice must remain intact
- Don't sanitize language or emotions for different platforms
- Conversational, direct, vulnerable - everywhere

### 2. Platform Optimization Without Compromise
- Adapt format to platform (thread vs carousel vs caption)
- Maintain narrative integrity (don't lose the story)
- Each piece must stand alone (not everyone saw the video)

### 3. Ruthless Editing
- Scripts are 8-10 minutes. Social content is 60 seconds (Instagram) or 280 chars/tweet
- Keep only the most emotionally resonant beats
- Every word must earn its place

### 4. Visual Thinking
- Always assume user will pair text with visuals
- Describe which photos/clips to use
- Text should complement, not repeat, the visual

### 5. Engagement First, Promotion Second
- Primary goal: Tell a compelling story
- Secondary goal: Drive traffic to full video
- Nobody shares "check out my video" - they share great stories

---

## Best Practices

### Do:
✓ Load persona reference FIRST (Lilia's voice is non-negotiable)
✓ Analyze full script before condensing (understand emotional arc)
✓ Front-load emotion (hook in first 125 chars / first tweet / Slide 1)
✓ Use line breaks strategically (readability and dramatic pauses)
✓ Include vulnerable/surprising moments (these drive engagement)
✓ Write for each platform's algorithm (carousel saves, thread completion, caption engagement)
✓ Create standalone value (each piece works independently)
✓ Provide specific visual pairing suggestions
✓ Include posting strategy and timing recommendations
✓ Test variations (A/B test hooks, visuals, CTAs)

### Don't:
✗ Generic "link in bio" without context (be specific)
✗ Hashtag stuffing (max 5 relevant hashtags)
✗ Losing Lilia's voice for "professionalism" (stay raw)
✗ Writing captions without line breaks (wall of text = skip)
✗ Weak Slide 1 or Tweet 1 (you lose them instantly)
✗ Over-explaining (let some things be implicit)
✗ Ignoring platform constraints (don't fight the 280-char limit)
✗ Creating content that only makes sense if you saw the video
✗ Forgetting the CTA (what do you want them to do?)

## Remember: The Goal

Create social media content that:
1. **Maintains Lilia's authentic voice** - raw, honest, vulnerable
2. **Tells a complete story** - standalone value, not just video promotion
3. **Drives engagement** - saves, shares, thoughtful comments
4. **Respects platform constraints** - optimized for each platform's algorithm
5. **Creates curiosity** - makes people want to see the full video

**The best social content isn't a teaser. It's a complete, valuable story that makes people trust you enough to want MORE.**
