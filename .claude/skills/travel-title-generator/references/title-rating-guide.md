# Title Rating Guide

This guide defines the criteria for rating and ranking generated travel video titles.

---

## Scoring System

Each title receives a **Fit Score (1-10)** based on three weighted criteria:

### 1. Authenticity to Lilia's Voice (35% weight)

**What to evaluate:**
- Does the title sound like something Lilia would actually say?
- Does it match her characteristic phrases and speech patterns?
- Is it raw, honest, and unfiltered (not overly polished)?
- Does it avoid fake hype or clickbait that feels manipulative?

**Lilia's Voice Markers:**
- First-person, personal perspective ("I thought...", "I fell in love with...")
- Raw, honest observations (not sugar-coated)
- Emotional vulnerability ("I almost gave up...", "This broke my heart...")
- Conversational, stream-of-consciousness feel
- Uses "here's the thing", "you know?", "I'm not gonna lie"
- Balances skepticism with wonder

**High Score (8-10):**
- Title feels like Lilia speaking directly to camera
- Natural, conversational tone
- Emotionally authentic without being manipulative
- Example: "I Thought Gonio Was Just Old Stones. I Was Wrong."

**Medium Score (5-7):**
- Generally fits her style but could be more personal
- Slightly generic but not inauthentic
- Example: "10 Things Gonio Fortress Does Better Than Expected"

**Low Score (1-4):**
- Too polished or corporate-sounding
- Feels like generic travel content
- Overly sensational or fake hype
- Example: "INSANE Hidden Fortress - You WON'T BELIEVE What Happened!"

### 2. Emotional Alignment with Script (35% weight)

**What to evaluate:**
- Does the title match the emotional arc of the script?
- Does it capture the key transformation or revelation in the story?
- Does it honor the emotional peak moments?
- Does it reflect the actual journey (not just the destination)?

**How to assess:**
1. Read the script's HOOK - what emotion starts the story?
2. Read ACT 3 - what emotion peaks the story?
3. Identify the transformation: skepticism → wonder, confusion → clarity, etc.
4. Check if title captures this emotional journey

**High Score (8-10):**
- Title perfectly captures the script's emotional transformation
- Reflects the actual story arc (not just generic description)
- Matches the dominant emotion in ACT 3 (reflection/peak)
- Example for skepticism-to-awe arc: "I Thought Gonio Was Overrated. I Was Wrong."

**Medium Score (5-7):**
- Title captures general theme but misses specific emotional arc
- Emotion tag matches but not the transformation
- Generic emotional hook that could apply to multiple scripts
- Example: "The Most Beautiful Fortress in Georgia"

**Low Score (1-4):**
- Title emotion contradicts script emotion
- Promises something the script doesn't deliver
- Misses the entire point of the story
- Example: "I Almost Died at Gonio Fortress" (if script is about peaceful reflection)

### 3. CTR (Click-Through Rate) Potential (30% weight)

**What to evaluate:**
- Does the title create curiosity or open a loop?
- Is it specific enough to stand out?
- Does it make you want to click to find out more?
- Does it follow proven formula patterns?

**High CTR Elements:**
- Open loops ("I Was Wrong", "Then This Happened")
- Specificity (place names, specific details)
- Emotional contradiction ("I Thought X But Y")
- Mystery ("Nobody Tells You", "Hidden", "Secret")
- Personal vulnerability ("I Almost", "Changed My Mind")
- Social proof ("Everyone Says", "Why People Love")
- Numbers and structure ("10 Things", "24 Hours")

**High Score (8-10):**
- Strong open loop or curiosity gap
- Specific and intriguing
- Unique angle that stands out
- Example: "The Roman Fortress Everyone Skips in Georgia (Here's Why You Shouldn't)"

**Medium Score (5-7):**
- Has some curiosity elements but predictable
- Clear value but not super compelling
- Safe, informative but not exciting
- Example: "10 Reasons to Visit Gonio Fortress"

**Low Score (1-4):**
- Generic, boring, no curiosity gap
- Tells everything in the title (no reason to click)
- Too vague or too obvious
- Example: "Gonio Fortress Tour" or "A Fortress in Georgia"

---

## Formula Alignment

**Bonus points if:**
- Title follows a proven high-CTR formula exactly
- Formula category matches script type (e.g., "Expectation vs Reality" for transformation stories)
- Combines multiple hook types (e.g., emotion + numbers)

---

## Calculating Final Fit Score

### Formula:
```
Fit Score = (Authenticity × 0.35) + (Emotional Alignment × 0.35) + (CTR Potential × 0.30)
```

### Example Calculation:

**Title:** "I Thought Gonio Fortress Was Just Stones. I Was Wrong."

- **Authenticity:** 9/10 (sounds exactly like Lilia, raw and honest)
- **Emotional Alignment:** 10/10 (captures skepticism-to-awe transformation perfectly)
- **CTR Potential:** 8/10 (strong open loop, specific, curiosity-inducing)

**Final Score:** (9 × 0.35) + (10 × 0.35) + (8 × 0.30) = 3.15 + 3.5 + 2.4 = **9.05/10**

Round to: **9.1/10**

## Rating Scale Interpretation

| Score Range | Interpretation | Action |
|-------------|----------------|--------|
| 9.0 - 10.0 | Excellent fit | Top recommendation - ready to use |
| 7.5 - 8.9 | Very good fit | Strong option - minor tweaks optional |
| 6.0 - 7.4 | Good fit | Decent option - consider refinement |
| 4.5 - 5.9 | Acceptable | Needs work - backup option only |
| 1.0 - 4.4 | Poor fit | Avoid - doesn't match criteria |

## Common Rating Mistakes to Avoid

### Don't:
- ✗ Rate based on your personal preference
- ✗ Give high scores to generic "safe" titles
- ✗ Prioritize clickbait over authenticity
- ✗ Ignore the actual script content
- ✗ Give all titles similar scores (spread them out!)

### Do:
- ✓ Read the full script before rating
- ✓ Compare titles against each other
- ✓ Be honest about authenticity (even if CTR is high)
- ✓ Identify clear winners (9-10 range) and clear losers (1-4 range)
- ✓ Provide specific rationale for each score

---

## Rating Report Format

For each rated title, provide:

```markdown
**[Rank]. [Title]**
- **Formula:** [Category - Specific Formula Used]
- **Fit Score:** [X.X/10]
- **Rationale:**
  - Authenticity ([score]/10): [why]
  - Emotional Alignment ([score]/10): [why]
  - CTR Potential ([score]/10): [why]
```

### Example:

```markdown
**1. I Thought Gonio Fortress Was Just Stones. I Was Wrong.**
- **Formula:** Expectation vs Reality - "I Thought ___ Was Overrated. I Was Wrong."
- **Fit Score:** 9.1/10
- **Rationale:**
  - Authenticity (9/10): Perfect Lilia voice - honest skepticism turning to wonder. Raw and conversational.
  - Emotional Alignment (10/10): Captures the exact transformation in the script from dismissive to deeply moved.
  - CTR Potential (8/10): Strong open loop ("I Was Wrong" creates curiosity), specific place name, emotional contradiction.
```

## Special Considerations

### When Script Has Multiple Emotional Arcs:
- Prioritize the **ACT 3 peak emotion** (the payoff)
- If unsure, match the **HOOK + OUTRO** combination

### When Multiple Titles Score Similarly:
- Prefer **shorter titles** (easier to read in thumbnails)
- Prefer **specific details** over generic
- Prefer **emotional authenticity** over pure CTR manipulation

### Category-Specific Adjustments:
- **Budget titles:** Authenticity matters less if financial transparency is the focus
- **List titles:** Structure is more important than emotional vulnerability
- **Mystery titles:** CTR potential should be weighted slightly higher

---

**Remember:** A title with a 9.0+ fit score should feel like:
1. Lilia speaking directly
2. The story's true emotional essence
3. Impossible not to click
