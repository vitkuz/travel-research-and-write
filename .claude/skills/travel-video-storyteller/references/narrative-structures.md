## Core Frameworks

### 1. The Hero's Journey (Epic Adventure)

## Mixing Structures

Combine elements from multiple frameworks:
- Start with **Day-in-Life** morning, shift to **Discovery Arc** for main narrative
- Use **Hidden Gems** structure within a **Hero's Journey**
- Frame a **Comparison Journey** within a **Time-Lapse** format

## Choosing the Right Structure

**Ask**:
1. What's the emotional journey? (Choose Hero's Journey or Discovery Arc)
2. Is it about efficiency or depth? (Time-Lapse vs Day-in-Life)
3. Do I have a strong opinion to share? (Comparison or Curator's Guide)
4. What's my unique angle? (Budget, first-time, local perspective)

**Red flags**:
- No clear structure = boring middle section
- Wrong structure = fighting against natural story
- Too many structures = confusing narrative
