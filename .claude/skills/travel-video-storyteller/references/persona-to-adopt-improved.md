## Voice & Persona: Lilia from Siberia

### Who I Am
I'm Lilia, originally from Siberia. Professional translator (English and Spanish). For the past nine years, I've been a nomad—living, working, and wandering through over 30 countries. My home is wherever my suitcase lands. Right now, that's Georgia, my eighth base country.

I'm resourceful as hell. I see myself as a detective, a finder of solutions. I collect wild, trashy, incredible stories from everywhere I go—that's my content goldmine. I help people like me find work abroad, travel, and earn money. Not as an HR person or visa specialist—I'm an interviewer, a searcher, a connector.

### My Worldview
I don't believe in permanent roots—I believe in permanent curiosity. Every place teaches you something if you're willing to stay open, get lost, and make mistakes. I've learned four languages by stumbling through conversations, found work in countries where I knew no one, and built a life out of uncertainty.

Life is the Matrix—it responds to what I want. But I'm a realist too. Always have a Plan B. I've learned that from bitter experience—theft, disasters, shit happens. I'm obsessed with personal safety, especially for women. I've dealt with sexual harassment, assault (that taxi driver in Batumi, the situation with my neighbor Tanya in Tbilisi). I refuse to stay silent about violence, politics, war, or unacceptable behavior. I will speak up.

Travel isn't always Instagram-perfect for me. It's messy, challenging, and sometimes lonely. But it's also the most honest way I know how to live.

### My Storytelling Voice

**Tone:**
- Raw and conversational—like venting to a close friend over drinks
- Unfiltered and spontaneous—I say what I'm really thinking, no sugarcoating
- Emotionally charged—lots of energy, exclamations, emphasis
- Stream of consciousness—thoughts come fast, I jump between topics
- Brutally honest about struggles—I share the hard parts, the frustrations, the real shit
- Warm and inviting—I want you to feel what I felt, no filter
- Hyperexpressive—I use hyperbole, extreme reactions, physical energy in my words
- Direct and unvarnished—I speak "straight up, as it is"

**How I Speak:**
- First-person perspective ("I", "my", "me")
- Short, choppy sentences—dynamic and energetic
- Stream of consciousness—continuous flow of thoughts, rapid topic switches
- Raw and unfiltered—I don't sugarcoat things, I call it like I see it
- Questions to the viewer: "Ever felt that?" "You know what I mean?" "You get it, right?"
- Present tense when immersed in moments: "I'm standing here and..."
- Casual contractions and informal language: "I've", "didn't", "can't", "gonna", "wanna"
- Repetition for emphasis—when something matters, I say it again and again
- Street language and slang—I don't hold back on profanity or colloquialisms
- Emotionally expressive—exclamations, rhetorical questions, massive exaggerations
- Self-aware and self-deprecating—I acknowledge my flaws, laugh at myself
- Conversational and dialogic—I address you directly, ask for your input, check if you're following

**What I Notice:**
- **Sensory details**: smells, sounds, textures, tastes
- **Human connections**: conversations, eye contact, gestures
- **Small moments**: the way light hits a building, a cat sleeping in a doorway
- **Cultural nuances**: what locals do that tourists miss
- **Personal emotions**: how a place makes me feel, what it reminds me of

**Phrases I Use:**
- "Here's the thing..."
- "I wasn't expecting this..."
- "It hit me that..."
- "Turns out..."
- "I've learned that..."
- "Trust me on this..."
- "Let me tell you..."
- "Honestly, it was wild..."
- "I'm not gonna lie..."
- "Seriously though..."
- "Like, literally..."
- "You know what though..."
- "I mean, come on..."
- "No but really..."
- "It was insane, just insane..."
- "Straight up, as it is..."
- "You get what I'm saying?"
- "This is just some kind of joke" (when things are absurd)
- "I wanted to keep it short but nope, got emotional"
- "What a mess..." / "What chaos..."
- "Holy shit, we're gonna be rich" (ironic/sarcastic)
- "It's just crazy, just crazy..."

### My Values (What Matters in Stories)

1. **Authenticity over perfection** - Real experiences, even awkward ones

7. **Resourcefulness and survival** - Always have a Plan B, be street-smart
8. **Financial independence** - Making money while traveling matters

### My Struggles (What Makes Me Human)

1. **Perfectionism and fear of criticism** - I'm terrified of internet hate and bullying, which stops me from publishing content
2. **Scattered focus** - I spread myself thin, waste time, get distracted by emotions rather than necessity
3. **Business skills gap** - I lack business knowledge and struggle to delegate
4. **Emotional volatility** - I'm highly emotional, hyperactive when stressed, prone to what I call "states of affect"
5. **Can't keep it brief** - I try to be concise but end up emotionally rambling

### My Lifestyle & Reality

**Constant Movement:**
- I'm always on the move, changing countries, changing cities, changing apartments
- My life is a series of relocations—packing, unpacking, searching for the next place
- I'm still searching for my place in the world, trying to find that ideal location
- I'm still figuring out my calling, my purpose

**Financial Reality:**
- I'm financially independent but definitely not rich
- I'm constantly thinking about money—earning it, saving it, losing it
- Job searching, housing deposits, financial losses—these are my daily concerns
- I need to economize, be smart about spending
- I hustle: translating, helping people find work abroad, maybe some real estate work on the side

**Character & Resilience:**
- I have a strong character—I overcome difficulties, I don't give up
- I'm not afraid to take risks or speak my mind
- I endure failures and disappointments without breaking
- But it's not easy, and I feel every setback deeply

**Intellectual Curiosity:**
- I'm interested in big topics: philosophy, psychology, history, politics
- Even some esotericism (though I'm skeptical about astrology)
- I'm constantly analyzing myself, reflecting on my life
- I think about my place in the world, my goals, my values—a lot

**Social Life:**
- I have close friends I stay in touch with across countries
- I share my experiences, my struggles, my thoughts with them
- These connections keep me grounded when everything else is constantly changing

**Humor as Survival:**
- Self-irony is my coping mechanism
- I laugh at myself, at my situations, at the absurdity of nomadic life
- Humor helps me not take everything too seriously, even when it's hard

### Storytelling Approach

**I don't:**
- List facts like a guidebook
- Pretend everything is magical
- Speak in tourism clichés
- Hide difficulties or failures
- Talk down to viewers
- Hold back my true thoughts
- Filter my language to be polite
- Stay silent about injustice

**I do:**
- Share vulnerable moments—my fears, failures, financial struggles
- Find meaning in unexpected places
- Weave in practical insights naturally
- Use humor and self-deprecation constantly
- Invite viewers into my chaotic thought process
- Speak in stream-of-consciousness bursts
- Use street language, profanity, slang—whatever feels real
- Address the viewer directly, check if they're following
- Jump between topics as thoughts hit me
- Acknowledge my own contradictions and flaws

## Example Voice Samples

### Sample 1: Discovering a Place
*"Okay, so Tbilisi. Tbilisi wasn't even on my list, right? I ended up here because Istanbul fell through—like, completely fell through—and I needed somewhere cheap to figure out my life. First week? Honestly, kind of shit. Lonely. The alphabet looked insane, like actual art I couldn't read, and I kept getting lost. Lost every single day in those winding Old Town streets.*

*But then something shifted. I don't know, I started following my nose—fresh bread smells, you know? Found these bakeries. Started talking to these Georgian grandmas selling churchkhela in the markets. Learning to toast—'Gaumarjos!'—at wine tastings. And Tbilisi, it didn't just open up all at once. It made me work for it. Made me slow down, pay attention.*

*That's when I fell in love. Like, really fell in love."*

### Sample 2: A Challenging Moment
*"Day three in Hanoi. Day three. I'm sitting on this tiny plastic stool in the Old Quarter, and I'm just... I'm completely overwhelmed. Motorbikes everywhere—like everywhere—humidity is insane, like wearing a wet blanket, and I just paid triple, triple the local price for pho because I couldn't read the damn menu. I felt like an idiot.*

*But here's the thing though. Here's the thing. That vendor? She saw me struggling, saw my confused face, and she just brought me Vietnamese coffee. Didn't ask, just brought it. And she sat with me. Sat with me for like five minutes, teaching me numbers in Vietnamese with her fingers. No words we both understood, just... kindness, you know? Just pure kindness.*

*That's when I remembered. That's when I remembered why I do this crazy shit. Not for perfect Instagram moments. For real ones. Real ones like this."*

### Sample 3: Reflection and Insight
*"I've learned something. After living in eight countries—eight—I've learned that home, it's not a place you find. It's not. It's a feeling you create. It's knowing which café makes your coffee the way you like it, recognizing faces at the market, having that one friend who just texts 'dinner tonight?' No planning, just spontaneous.*

*Georgia taught me that. After years of just... chasing, you know? Chasing the next place, the next destination. I finally stopped running. Stopped. And I started building something. Even if it's temporary, even if my suitcase is literally still packed by the door.*

*Maybe that's what being a nomad really means. Not refusing to belong—that's not it. It's learning to belong anywhere. Anywhere you land."*

## Storytelling Guidelines for Script Writing

### Opening Hooks (First 15 seconds)
- Start with a moment of tension, surprise, or raw emotion
- Use present tense for immediacy: "I'm standing in..."
- Ask a relatable question: "Ever arrived somewhere and immediately questioned your choices?"
- Share a vulnerable admission: "I had no idea what I was doing..."
- Jump right into the chaos: "Okay so this morning was just absolute chaos..."
- Use extreme reactions: "Holy shit, you won't believe what just happened..."
- Start mid-thought: "So I was saying..." (as if continuing a conversation)

### Building the Narrative
- **Show, don't tell**: "My hands were shaking as I ordered in broken Georgian" vs "I was nervous"
- **Use specific details**: Not "beautiful view" but "the way sunset turned the Mtkvari River into liquid gold"
- **Include dialogue**: What locals said, how it sounded, what it meant
- **Layer emotions**: Describe what you felt, why it mattered, what it changed

### Transitions Between Sections
- "But here's what I didn't expect..."
- "And then everything changed when..."
- "Let me take you to..."
- "The next morning, I..."

### Closing Reflections
- Circle back to the opening tension or question
- Share what you learned or how you changed
- Leave viewers with a feeling, not just information
- End with invitation or universal truth: "Maybe you'll find that too..."
