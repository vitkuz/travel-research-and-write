  "description": "Independence Square (formerly Lenin Square until 1991) is one of the largest squares in Europe and the most significant square in Belarus. Located in the heart of Minsk, it serves as a symbol of Belarusian statehood, culture, and history. Designed by renowned Soviet architect Iosif Langbard in the 1930s, the square showcases grandiose Stalinist architecture and has been the stage for major historical events including Soviet-era military parades and the 2020 Belarusian protests.",
  "highlights": [
    "One of the largest squares in Europe covering massive central area",
    "Government House - dominant constructivist building from 1930-1935 housing Parliament and Council of Ministers",
    "Red Church (Church of Saints Simon and Helena) - neo-Gothic pearl built from red bricks in 1905-1910",
    "Three Storks Fountain with glass dome featuring 700 water jets and bronze stork sculptures",
    "Underground Stolitsa shopping center spanning 807,000 square-feet on three levels",
    "Minsk Metro's Ploshcha Lyenina station (retains Soviet-era name)",
    "National Assembly of Belarus and Minsk City Hall buildings",
    "Memorial bell for Chernobyl victims"
  ],

    "Metro access is convenient via Ploshcha Lyenina station",

  "vibe": "Imposing Soviet grandeur meets modern urban functionality. The square exudes a sense of ceremonial importance with its massive constructivist government buildings and wide-open spaces designed for rallies and parades. Yet it balances this heavy historical weight with contemporary touches - the whimsical Three Storks Fountain, bustling underground shopping center, and pedestrian-friendly walking paths. The dramatic contrast between the red neo-Gothic church and grey Soviet concrete creates visual tension that symbolizes Belarus itself: caught between different eras and identities.",
