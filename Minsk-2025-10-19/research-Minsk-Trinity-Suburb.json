  "description": "Trinity Suburb (Trajeckaje pradmiescie) is an old picturesque historic district in central Minsk, located on the bank of the Svisloch River. Featuring cozy little streets lined with 19th-century stone buildings with tile roofs and delicate pastel colors, this reconstructed quarter has become a symbol of Minsk. The settlement originally appeared in the 12th-13th centuries and served as a major commercial center where roads from Vilno, Polotsk, Smolensk and Mogilev intersected. After the great fire of 1809 destroyed the ancient design, new stone buildings were erected under Emperor Alexander I's approved project. The district was extensively renovated in the 1980s to recreate the atmosphere of 19th-century Minsk, and in 2004 it was officially included in the Old Town complex.",

    "Trinity Suburb serves as the primary filming location for all 19th-century period dramas in Belarus, with approximately 10 film shoots occurring regularly",

    "Only 40% of buildings serve residential purposes - the rest are commercial, cultural, or tourism-focused",
    "The pristine, perfect condition of buildings reveals their recent construction rather than centuries of history",
