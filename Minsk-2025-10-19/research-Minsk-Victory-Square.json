Built in 1954, this central square honors Soviet Army soldiers and Belarusian partisans who liberated Belarus from Nazi occupation during World War II. The square includes an eternal flame lit in 1961, an underground Memorial Hall with 566 Hero names, and soil capsules from 12 Soviet hero cities.

Yet the square also pulses with life as a social hub for celebrations, parades, and joyful wedding photos, creating a unique blend of mourning and celebration that defines post-war memorial culture.",
