## 🎬 Voiceover Script

### 1. The Dismissal (0:00-0:25)

Okay so. Gorky Park. When my friend suggested it, I literally rolled my eyes. Like, a children's park? Really? I'm not here for carousels and cotton candy, I'm here to understand Minsk. But she just smiled and said, "Trust me. Just go."

I went. And here's the thing - I had absolutely no idea what I was walking into.

**Scene Notes:** Entrance shot, carousel visible, voiceover with slight skepticism turning to curiosity

### 2. First Layer - Surface Impressions (0:25-1:00)

So yeah, first impression? Kids. Everywhere. Ferris wheel, 29 different attractions - more than any other park in Minsk, apparently. Families feeding ducks by the artificial lake, this fairy tale castle that looks like something from a Disney movie.

I'm thinking, okay, cute, whatever. Nice place to bring your toddler.

But then I start noticing things. These trees, right? They're not just... trees. They're massive. Ancient. Like, they've seen some shit. And there's this planetarium just sitting there, and an Ice Palace, and... wait, why does a children's park need an observatory?

Something's not adding up.

**Scene Notes:** Montage of attractions, families, then slow pan to old trees, close-up of planetarium building

### 3. The Unraveling (1:00-2:00)

Turns out? This place was founded in 1805. 1805! By Minsk's first governor, some guy named Zakhar Korneev. It was Eastern Europe's first public garden - like, the first time regular people could just walk into a designed green space. English-style landscaping, super fancy for its time.

So I'm standing here, and I'm realizing I'm not in a kids' park. I'm in a 220-year-old witness to everything that's happened in Belarus.

During Soviet times? This wasn't about ponies and paddleboats. They held poetry evenings here. Amateur theater performances. Artists setting up easels for plein air lessons. This was like... a cultural hub, you know? Where people came to think, to create, to breathe.

And then World War Two destroyed the neighborhoods around it. Just flattened them. The park expanded from 18 hectares to 28 because there was literally nothing left around it but rubble. One of those lost buildings? The house where Belarusian writer Yakub Kolas lived. Gone.

The trees I'm looking at? They watched all of that.

**Scene Notes:** Historical photo overlays, sweeping shots of century-old trees, transition to quieter corners of park

### 4. The Presidential Twist (2:00-2:45)

But wait, it gets weirder. You see that Ice Palace over there? President Lukashenko plays hockey there. Like, regularly. The president. Just shows up to play hockey at the children's park.

And when he's there? Parts of the park close. Security everywhere. You can't access certain areas because the president is literally skating around in his hockey gear at the place where kids usually get ice cream.

I mean, come on. This is just some kind of joke, right? But it's real. It's so Belarus it hurts.

You can also stargaze here during the daytime at the planetarium and observatory - they built those specifically when the park got designated as a children's park in 1960. Before that? This place was called Governor's Garden, then City Park, then Profintern Park, and finally Gorky Park in 1936.

Four names. Multiple identities. Like it keeps reinventing itself every few decades, trying to figure out what it wants to be.

**Scene Notes:** Ice Palace exterior, subtle tension in music, shots of observatory dome, playful yet serious tone

### 5. The Realization (2:45-3:30)

So I spent three hours here. Three hours in a place I almost skipped because I thought it was "just for kids."

I rode the Ferris wheel - 56 meters high, takes about 10 minutes to go around, and you can see all of Minsk spreading out below you. I fed squirrels with bread I bought from a vendor. I sat under trees that are older than my great-grandparents. I took a boat ride on the Svislach River - the same river where 19th-century governors once strolled.

And I kept thinking... this is the thing about travel, you know? The thing I keep learning over and over. The most important places don't announce themselves. They don't have big signs saying "SIGNIFICANT HISTORY HERE." They just sit quietly, looking like children's parks, waiting for you to slow down enough to notice.

Gorky Park didn't just surprise me. It reminded me that every place has layers. Every single place. You just have to be willing to dig past the carousel and the cotton candy.

220 years of poetry, war, politics, art, survival - and yeah, also ponies and paddle boats. Because maybe that's the most Belarusian thing of all. Holding all of it at once. The weight of history and the lightness of children's laughter, existing in the same 28 hectares.

I'm glad my friend made me go. I'm really glad.
