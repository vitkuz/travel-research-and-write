  "vibe": "A journey through time that connects ancient civilizations to modern struggles for independence. The museum balances scholarly depth with emotional resonance, from the glittering splendor of 3000-year-old Colchian gold to the sobering documentation of Soviet repression. The basement treasury feels like discovering hidden treasure, while the top floor confronts Georgia's painful 20th century with dignity and defiance. Educational yet deeply moving, this is where Georgia's national identity is both preserved and proclaimed."
