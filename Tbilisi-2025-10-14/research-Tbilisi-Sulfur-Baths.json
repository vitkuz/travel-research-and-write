  "place": "Sulfur Baths (Abanotubani)",
  "type": "cultural",
  "description": "The ancient sulfur baths of Abanotubani are the heart and soul of Tbilisi, nestled in the oldest district of the city. These natural hot springs, discovered by King Vakhtang Gorgasali in the 5th century, gave Tbilisi its name - derived from 'tbili' meaning 'warm'. The district features distinctive brick-domed bathhouses showcasing a fascinating blend of Persian, Georgian, and Byzantine architectural styles, half-submerged into the ground with their ornate domes visible from the street. For centuries, these sulfur-rich thermal waters have been central to Georgian culture, serving not just as places for bathing but as vital social hubs where important decisions were debated, business deals were made, and communities gathered.",
