  "type": "cultural",
  "description": "An iconic open-air flea market located on the former Dry Bridge (Mshrali Khidi) and adjacent Dedaena and 9 March parks. Known as 'the market of memories,' it is Tbilisi's premier destination for Soviet-era memorabilia, antiques, vintage items, and contemporary Georgian art. The market emerged after the Soviet Union's collapse in the 1990s when locals began selling their possessions to make ends meet, though its roots trace back to the 1950s. The name comes from its location on a bridge over a dried-up arm of the Kura River.",

    "Vintage collectibles: old rubles, coins, matchboxes, stamps, vinyl records, CDs, Russian language books, old maps, and caviar tins",

  "tips": [
    "TIMING: Visit on Saturdays or Sundays between 11:00 AM and 4:00 PM for the liveliest atmosphere with maximum vendors. Avoid Mondays when the market is only half full. Arrive early for first pick of items and to avoid afternoon crowds",
    "BARGAINING: Haggling is expected and part of the culture. Start at one-third of the asking price. Prices are often higher for tourists. Speaking Russian may help get better deals. Approach bargaining with friendliness and respect",
    "PAYMENT: Cash only - bring Georgian Lari in small denominations to facilitate easier transactions. No credit cards accepted",
    "AUTHENTICITY: Be cautious about reproductions versus genuine antiques. Some vendors sell modern replicas (like shiny Stalin flasks also found in museum gift shops). If you're a serious collector, inquire about provenance before purchasing",
    "WEATHER: The market may not operate if weather is bad, as it's entirely outdoors",
    "LANGUAGE: Vendors may speak Georgian, Russian, and limited English. Russian language skills helpful for better prices",
    "RESPECT: Remember that some booths are run by locals selling their own possessions to make ends meet. Be polite and considerate",
    "EXPLORATION: Take time to explore all three areas - the bridge itself, Dedaena Park, and 9 March Park - each has different specialties",
    "PRICE RANGES: Prices are generally rock bottom and can be haggled even lower. Small items like Soviet pins and medals: 5-20 GEL; Vintage cameras and larger collectibles: 30-100+ GEL; Artwork varies widely based on artist and size",
    "NEARBY COMBINATION: After shopping, relax in adjacent Dedaena or 9 March parks. The market's central location makes it easy to walk to other attractions"

  "vibe": "A nostalgic treasure hunt through Soviet history meets vibrant local art scene. The atmosphere is eclectic and somewhat chaotic, with vendors displaying everything from genuine historical artifacts to quirky knick-knacks on blankets and makeshift tables. Artists work alongside memorabilia dealers, creating a unique blend of past and present Georgian culture. The market has an authentic, unpolished character - it's not overly touristy despite its popularity. Weekend visits feel more energetic with crowds of both locals and tourists hunting for bargains, while weekdays are quieter and more intimate. There's a sense of living history as you browse through items that tell stories of Georgia's Soviet past, mixed with the creative energy of contemporary Georgian artists. The bargaining culture adds an interactive, social element to shopping. Overall, it's an atmospheric experience that offers both cultural insight and the thrill of discovery, whether you're seeking Soviet kitsch, genuine antiques, or original artwork. The market serves as both a window into Georgia's complex 20th-century history and a showcase for its modern creative spirit."
