  "description": "The Holy Trinity Cathedral, known locally as Sameba, is the largest cathedral in Georgia and the third-tallest Eastern Orthodox cathedral in the world. Standing at 101 meters high on Elia Hill overlooking the Kura River, this architectural masterpiece combines traditional Georgian church styles with Byzantine elements. Constructed between 1995 and 2004, it was built to commemorate 1,500 years of autocephaly of the Georgian Orthodox Church and 2,000 years from the birth of Jesus. The cathedral's massive golden dome, covered with one ton of gold and crowned by an 8.1-meter high cross, dominates Tbilisi's skyline. The complex can accommodate up to 15,000 people and includes nine chapels (five underground), a free-standing bell tower, the Patriarch's residence, a monastery, clerical seminary, and theological academy.",
