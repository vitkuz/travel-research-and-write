  "vibe": "Sacred and majestic. Standing on this ancient cliff where Tbilisi was born, you feel the weight of 1,500 years of history beneath your feet. The church rises like a natural extension of the rock, while the bronze king on horseback gazes eternally over the city he founded. It's a place where legend and history intertwine - from the founding myth of the falcon and pheasant falling into hot springs, to the tragic tale of 100,000 martyrs who refused to step on icons, to the artist who sacrificed his life to save this building from demolition. The panoramic views are simply breathtaking, especially during golden hour when Old Tbilisi glows across the river. Despite its dramatic history including use as a prison where revolutionaries were held, the site maintains a serene spiritual atmosphere. The neighborhood itself feels like stepping back through centuries, where every stone tells a story of kings, saints, and the resilient Georgian spirit. It's both a photographer's paradise and a pilgrim's destination, offering moments of contemplation alongside stunning vistas."
