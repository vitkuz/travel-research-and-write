# Holy Trinity Cathedral (Sameba)

You climb the steep steps toward Elia Hill, and suddenly, it appears: a golden dome blazing against the sky, pulling your gaze upward to 101 meters where an 8-meter cross pierces the heavens. One ton of gold catches the sunlight, announcing Sameba's presence across Tbilisi like a beacon of resurrection.

You pass through the entrance, borrowing a headscarf from the basket, and step inside. The air shifts immediately—cooler, heavy with incense, alive with whispers. Every surface sings with frescoes and mosaics. Byzantine eyes watch from the walls, painted by Georgian masters, some by the Patriarch's own hand. You descend into the underground chapels, five hidden chambers where stone and gold create intimate sanctuaries beneath the grandeur above.

Back in the main nave, you look up. The dome seems to float, impossibly high, holding space for 15,000 souls. You hear the echo of Orthodox chanting, feel the weight of 1,500 years of faith reborn after Soviet silence.

This is more than architecture—it's Georgia's spiritual heart beating again, inviting you to witness resilience made manifest in stone and gold.
