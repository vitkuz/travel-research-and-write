Originally installed in 1977 by Georgian architect Giorgi Erkomaishvili with Armenian engineers, these spectacular water features combine synchronized water jets, colorful lights, and music to create mesmerizing evening performances. The main installation at Ardagani Lake was enhanced in 2009 with French musical fountain technology, featuring a three-dimensional laser show. The fountains are located at three key locations: the Old Boulevard, Ardagani Lake (the largest), and Europe Square.",
