The park earned its name from the surprisingly rapid completion of its construction. It serves as a showcase of modern architecture and contemporary sculptures, blending historical landmarks like the 19th-century lighthouse with cutting-edge artistic installations. The park has become a central hub for cultural events, festivals, and leisure activities, offering visitors a unique blend of art, entertainment, and coastal atmosphere.",
  "highlights": [
    "Ali and Nino Statue: An iconic 8-meter moving iron sculpture depicting a touching love story between an Azerbaijani youth and Georgian princess.

    "Chacha Tower: A 25-meter clock tower that dispenses Georgia's traditional grape brandy (chacha) from four stations every day at 7 PM for ten minutes - a unique and popular attraction for visitors",
    "Historic Batumi Lighthouse: A 21-meter stone lighthouse built by French engineers in 1882, one of the last remaining relics of Batumi's history in an area dominated by modern development. A lighthouse has stood at this location since 1863 during Ottoman rule",
