  "type": "attraction",
  "description": "The Chacha Tower is a distinctive 25-meter high clock tower located on Batumi's Black Sea waterfront in Miracle Park. Completed in 2012, it is a faithful replica of an Ottoman-style clock tower that stood in Batumi at the beginning of the 20th century, originally designed by French architect Raymond Pere in 1901. The tower was conceived as a unique attraction featuring fountains that would dispense Georgia's national spirit, chacha, making it one of the world's most unusual public monuments.",

    "Originally featured fountains designed to dispense free chacha to visitors",
    "Surrounded by four decorative pools with circulation systems",
    "Located in scenic Miracle Park near the Ferris wheel and seaport",

  ],
  "vibe": "Historic and quirky - a whimsical tribute to Georgian drinking culture that has become a neglected but charming landmark. The tower represents Batumi's ambitious efforts to create unique tourist attractions, blending traditional architecture with contemporary novelty. While the original concept of free-flowing chacha fountains no longer operates, the tower remains a distinctive symbol of Georgian hospitality and the country's deep-rooted relationship with its national spirit. The waterfront location provides a romantic setting, especially when illuminated at night, though visitors should adjust expectations knowing the interactive element is no longer functional.",
