# The Promise of Chacha Tower

You stand before the Ottoman-style clock tower on Batumi's waterfront as twilight deepens. Twenty-five meters of cream-colored stone rise against the darkening sky, its domes catching the last amber light. The Black Sea whispers behind you, salt-scented wind tugging at your hair.

This is Chacha Tower—a monument to Georgian generosity, a replica of a French architect's 1901 design. You climb the stairs to the observation platform, each step echoing through the empty structure. The clock at eighteen meters stands frozen, silent testimony to grander ambitions. Four decorative pools circle the base below, their fountains long dry.

The tower was meant to flow with chacha, Georgia's fiery grape spirit—an audacious promise of hospitality turned into stone and plumbing. For a brief moment in 2012, it actually happened: fountains dispensing free chacha to delighted visitors. But the flow stopped in 2015, leaving only the story.

As night falls, lights illuminate the tower's ornate details, transforming it into something magical again. You realize this neglected monument captures something essentially Georgian—an extravagant gesture of welcome that lingers even when the glass runs dry. The spirit remains, even if the chacha doesn't.
