# Dancing Fountains - Batumi

You arrive at Ardagani Lake just as twilight bleeds into darkness, the last amber streaks fading behind Batumi's glass towers. Around you, families claim spots on benches, couples stroll arm-in-arm along the water's edge, and vendors hawk warm churchkhela from wooden carts. The air smells of roasted hazelnuts and the salt-tinged Black Sea breeze.

Then, at exactly 9 PM, the first notes of Pavarotti pierce the night. Water erupts skyward in synchronized columns, transforming into liquid sculptures that curve, spiral, and cascade in perfect rhythm. Colored lights turn the jets into ribbons of emerald, sapphire, and crimson, while lasers carve three-dimensional illusions through the dancing streams. The fountains seem alive, breathing with the music—now graceful during a Georgian ballad, now explosive as Diana Ross's voice soars.

For fifteen mesmerizing minutes, you forget you're standing in a modern resort city. You're suspended in pure spectacle, where Soviet-era ambition meets French technology, where water becomes art. When the final jet collapses into stillness and applause ripples around the lake, you realize you're already counting the minutes until the next performance.

This is Batumi's gift: beauty that costs nothing but attention.
