# Piazza Square: A Hidden Italian Dream in Batumi's Heart

You slip through a narrow passage between buildings, and suddenly—everything changes. The Georgian streets vanish. Before you stands a slice of Florence, impossibly transplanted to the Black Sea coast. Batumi's Piazza Square opens like a secret whispered only to those who search.

Your eyes drop to the ground, and breath catches. Beneath your feet lies Europe's largest figurative marble mosaic—88 million pieces, each no bigger than your fingernail, assembled into a swirling masterpiece of five water deities. You kneel, tracing the intricate patterns with your fingertips, marveling that Georgian-Swiss artist Natalie de Pita-Amirejibi spent years creating this oceanic dance from marble sourced across 15 countries.

The clock tower rises above, its Italian architecture framing intimate cafes where espresso mingles with Georgian wine. Stained-glass windows by Estonian artist Dolores Hoffman catch the afternoon light, casting colored shadows across cobblestones. As evening descends, decorative lights transform the square into something magical—neither fully Georgian nor Italian, but uniquely its own.

This hidden piazza whispers a truth: the most extraordinary discoveries often hide in plain sight, waiting just beyond the obvious path.
