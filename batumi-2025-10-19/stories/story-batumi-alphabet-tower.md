## 🎬 Voiceover Script

### 1. Hook - The Skeptical Arrival (0:00-0:35)

Okay, so. Alphabet Tower. When I first saw it on the list of things to do in Batumi, I was like... really? A tower with letters? That's it? That's the thing everyone talks about?

I mean, come on. It sounded touristy as hell. Like one of those things they build just to put on postcards, you know? Just another gimmick in a city that's already full of them.

But I went anyway. Because that's what I do—I check things out, even when I'm skeptical. Even when I'm already judging before I arrive.

Turns out... I had no idea what I was walking into. No idea.

**Scene Notes:** Approaching the tower through Miracle Park, showing initial skepticism through body language, eye rolls at tourist crowds

### 2. First Impressions - Bigger Than Expected (0:35-1:20)

Here's the thing though. Here's the thing.

When you get up close to this tower, those letters—those 33 Georgian letters—they're four meters tall. Four meters. Each one. They're massive, like absolutely massive aluminum sculptures spiraling up this 130-meter tower.

And I'm standing there, neck craned back, trying to take it all in, and I notice the pattern. It's not just random. It's a double helix. Like DNA. Like the actual genetic structure of DNA.

At first I'm thinking, "Okay, cool design choice. Very sci-fi. Very architectural." I'm already mentally composing my Instagram caption—something about spirals and skylines and modern architecture, whatever.

But then I actually stopped and read the plaque. Actually asked at the tourist information center at the base what this meant. And that's when my whole cynical-tourist brain just... stopped.

This isn't decoration. This is a statement. This is Georgia saying: our language is our genetic code. Our identity. Our survival mechanism.

The Georgian alphabet—it's one of only 14 alphabets still used in the world today. Fourteen. Out of all the languages that have ever existed. And it's on UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage list.

I wasn't expecting that. I wasn't expecting depth. I wasn't expecting to actually feel something.

### 3. Going Up - The Rotating Revelation (1:20-2:25)

So obviously I went up. Obviously.

There's this rotating restaurant at the top. And I booked it last minute—barely got a table because turns out this place is actually popular with locals, not just tourists like me stumbling in. That should've been my first clue that this was more than just a view.

The restaurant does a full 360-degree rotation in exactly one hour. One hour. And you know what the wild part is? You don't even feel it. You don't feel it moving at all. You're sitting there eating khachapuri, sipping Georgian wine—which by the way is incredible, Georgian wine is seriously underrated—and suddenly the mountains are where the sea was. The city lights are where the sunset was. It's so smooth, so imperceptible.

I spent two hours up there. Two full hours. Not because I'm a slow eater—trust me, I can demolish khachapuri in record time—but because I couldn't stop watching Batumi unfold beneath me.

The Black Sea just stretching out forever, this deep dark blue going to the horizon. The Ajara mountains rising in the distance on clear days. The whole city grid laid out like a living map beneath you. And at night? Holy shit, at night when the tower lights up, you can see it from everywhere in Batumi. From the beach, from the old town, from across the city. It becomes this glowing beacon.

And the whole time I'm up there, slowly rotating, I'm thinking about those letters outside. About what the architect—Alberto Domingo Cabo, same guy who designed that crazy futuristic Parliament Building in Kutaisi—about what he understood. He got it. Language isn't just words. It's cultural DNA. It's how identity gets passed down, protected, preserved.

I got it then. I finally got why this matters so much.

### 4. The Deeper Meaning - What I Learned (2:25-3:05)

Georgia has been invaded how many times? Occupied, erased, rewritten by empires—Persian, Ottoman, Russian, Soviet. Over and over and over. But you know what survived through all of that? The language. The alphabet. Twenty-seven centuries old and it's still here. Still theirs. Still untouched.

This tower—it's not about tourism. It's not about getting good Instagram photos, though yeah, they're pretty damn good. It's about resilience. It's about Georgia standing up and saying: you can take our land, you can redraw our borders, you can occupy us for decades. But you can't take our words. You can't take who we are at our core.

I met this Georgian woman at the observation deck. She was there with her daughter, maybe seven or eight years old, teaching her to identify each letter on the tower. And I asked her—in my broken, terrible Georgian mixed with English—I asked why the alphabet matters so much.

And she looked at me like I'd asked why breathing matters. She said, "Our alphabet is our soul." Just like that. "Our alphabet is our soul."

That hit me. That just hit me so hard I had to walk away for a second.

Because I get it now. When you're a country that's been fighting to exist for millennia, your language isn't just communication. It's proof. Proof that you're still here. Proof that they didn't win.

### 5. Reflection - Why It Matters (3:05-3:30)

I came to Batumi expecting beaches and casinos and maybe some decent wine. I did not—I did not—come expecting to feel this much about an alphabet I can't even read. An alphabet that looks like art to me, like beautiful incomprehensible art.

But that's the thing about travel though, right? The things that actually change you, that actually stay with you—they're never the things you planned for. Never the things on your checklist. They're the moments when you stop being a tourist and start actually paying attention.

The Alphabet Tower isn't just a landmark. It's not just a place to get a good view, though the views are spectacular, they really are. It's a love letter. From Georgia to Georgia. Written 130 meters high in letters that survived everything history threw at them.

And if you go—when you go—don't just take the photo from the bottom and walk away. Go up. Sit in that rotating restaurant. Let Batumi spin around you slowly. Read the information at the tourist center at the base. Ask someone why it matters. Actually ask.

Because some towers are just towers. Places to check off your list, places to say you've been. But this one? This one speaks. And if you listen—really listen—it'll tell you what survival sounds like.
