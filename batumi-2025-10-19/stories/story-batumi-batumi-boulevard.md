## 🎬 Voiceover Script

### 1. The Hook - First Impressions (0:00-0:25)

Okay so here's the thing about Batumi Boulevard. When I first got here, I thought—cool, a seaside promenade, I'll walk it in like thirty minutes, grab some coffee, done. Classic tourist shit, right?

Wrong. So wrong.

This boulevard? It's seven kilometers long. Seven. That's like, what, four miles? I didn't know that. Nobody told me that. I just started walking and... it kept going. And going. And I'm thinking—wait, is this still the same boulevard?

Turns out, I wasn't walking a promenade. I was walking through 140 years of history.

**Scene Notes:** Opening with wide drone shot of the full 7km stretch, then cut to Lilia's surprised face looking at a map

### 2. The Discovery - Layers of Time (0:25-1:05)

Let me tell you how this place was built, because it's wild. 1881—German gardeners show up under some governor and start planting trees. Then a French architect, this guy Michael D'Alfons, comes in the 1880s and renovates the whole thing in French style. They literally call him the "Genius of Batumi sea coast." I mean, come on.

Fast forward to the 1930s—boom, they build these elegant white Greek-style columns, the Batumi Colonnades. Then in 1948, they construct the Summer Theater—and here's the crazy part—the entire wooden building, the entire thing, was built without a single nail. Not one. It's still standing. Still there.

And then in 2009, a Spanish architect designs the New Boulevard expansion. So you're walking through Germany, France, Greece, Soviet Georgia, and Spain all at once. It's like Europe threw up on a coastline and somehow it's gorgeous.

### 3. The Surprise - What Nobody Expects (1:05-1:45)

But here's what I didn't expect. You know what I didn't expect?

Over 40,000 trees. Forty thousand trees planted along this thing. It's not just a promenade—it's an urban forest next to the sea. You're walking under this massive green canopy, Black Sea on one side, and the air smells like salt and pine and fresh bread from the cafes.

And there's a zoo. A zoo. Right on the boulevard. Over 140 animals just chilling there. Who puts a zoo on a seaside promenade? Georgia does, apparently.

Oh, and the lighthouse? Built in 1882, still functioning as a hydrographic center. Weather forecasters literally observe conditions 24/7 from there. And get this—it sits where the 41st parallels of longitude and latitude coincide. Like, the exact same number. How is that even possible?

I'm not gonna lie, I felt like I was discovering secrets nobody bothered to mention in any guidebook.

### 4. The Experience - Day Turns to Night (1:45-2:30)

So I walked it during the day first. Families everywhere, kids on amusement rides, people cycling past me on the bike paths—I should've rented a bike, honestly, my feet were dying—and these craft vendors selling jewelry and random souvenirs.

Peaceful. Relaxing. Kind of perfect.

Then I came back at night. And it transformed. It literally transformed into a different place.

The dancing fountains—they go off every ten minutes, synchronized with music and lights. Every ten minutes. And people gather, like actually gather around them, phones out, just watching water dance to Georgian pop music. It's cheesy. It's touristy. And I stood there for like twenty minutes just watching because... I don't know, it made me happy. Just pure, stupid happy.

The whole boulevard lights up—cafes packed, beach bars blasting music, couples walking hand-in-hand, and the sea just... glittering under all those lights.

You get what I'm saying? It's not one experience. It's two completely different moods depending on when you show up.

**Scene Notes:** Day-to-night transition montage, dancing fountains with crowd reactions, night lights reflecting on water, bustling cafe scenes

### 5. The Reflection - What It Means (2:30-3:00)

I've walked a lot of waterfronts. I've walked a lot of famous promenades in a lot of countries. But Batumi Boulevard? It's something else.

It's not trying to be perfect or polished or Instagram-ready—though honestly, it is gorgeous. It's just... layered. It's been evolving for over a century. German gardeners, French genius, Soviet builders, Spanish designers—they all left their mark. And somehow it works. Somehow it all fits together.

Maybe that's the beauty of it. It doesn't belong to one era, one style, one vision. It belongs to everyone who's ever walked it.

And yeah, my feet were absolutely destroyed after seven kilometers. But I'd do it again.

Trust me on this—give yourself time. Don't rush it. Let the boulevard unfold.
