## 🎬 Voiceover Script

### 1. Hook - "Low Expectations Arrival" (0:00-0:25)

Okay so, botanical garden. I mean, come on—I've seen gardens, right? Plants, flowers, maybe some nice paths. I figured an hour, tops. Take some photos, check it off the list, move on.

I wasn't expecting this.

**Scene Notes:** Wide establishing shot of entrance, then quick cuts showing glimpses of different zones

### 2. First Reveal - "The Scale Hits" (0:25-1:10)

Here's the thing though—this place is 108 hectares. One hundred and eight. That's like... that's massive, right? And it's not flat, it's not some nice flat garden with benches. It's literally built into these coastal cliffs along the Black Sea. So you're walking uphill, downhill, winding paths, and every turn—every single turn—you're in a completely different world.

Like, literally five minutes ago I was in Japan. Bamboo groves everywhere, that rustling sound bamboo makes, you know? And now I'm standing in what feels like Mexico. Desert plants. Cacti. The humidity just... gone. It's insane, just insane.

They call this place nine floristic sectors. Which is a fancy way of saying you can visit the Himalayas, New Zealand, South America, the Mediterranean—all before lunch. Without leaving Georgia.

**Scene Notes:** Walking through bamboo transition to desert zone; show contrast; close-ups of exotic plants with labels

### 3. Discovery Build - "Each Zone Deepens" (1:10-2:05)

And it's not some theme park thing, you get what I'm saying? This is real science. Over 2,000 plant species. Some of these specimens—these actual trees and plants—they're over a hundred years old. Planted by this Russian botanist, Andrey Krasnov, back in the 1880s. He literally chose this exact spot, the Green Cape they call it, because the climate here... it's perfect for this crazy experiment.

I'm walking through these groves of eucalyptus from Australia, then suddenly I'm in Caucasian humid subtropics—which is, let me tell you, humid as hell—with these ancient rhododendrons and magnolias. And then you turn another corner and boom, Black Sea view. Just... stretching forever. The water, the cliffs, the sky.

Three hours in, I'm not even halfway through. Three hours. I brought a small water bottle. Rookie mistake.

**Scene Notes:** Montage of different zones; historical photos of Krasnov; dramatic Black Sea viewpoint reveal; self-aware moment checking watch

### 4. Climax - "The Realization" (2:05-2:50)

You know what hit me though? Standing there, looking out at the sea from these cliff paths, surrounded by plants from nine different continents... this isn't just a garden. It's not. It's this man's dream—Krasnov's dream—to prove that different worlds can coexist in one place.

He opened this in 1912. 1912. Before world wars, before the Soviet Union, before any of us. And it's still here. Still growing. Still teaching people that, like... I don't know, that diversity isn't just possible, it's beautiful when you actually plan for it. When you create space for everything to thrive.

That got me emotional. I wanted to keep it short but nope, got emotional.

Because I'm literally living that life, right? Eight base countries, constantly moving, trying to figure out where I belong. And maybe the answer is what this garden shows—you don't pick one. You create space for all of it.

**Scene Notes:** Slow pan across mixed flora; reflective moment at viewpoint; close-up of century-old tree plaque; quieter, more intimate framing

### 5. Resolution - "The Call" (2:50-3:30)

If you go—and honestly, you should go—budget four hours minimum. Wear good shoes, the paths are steep as hell. Bring water, bring snacks. Come in spring if you can, when the rhododendrons are blooming, but honestly any season works.

It costs like 20 GEL to get in. That's nothing. That's absolutely nothing for what you get.

And here's what nobody tells you: you won't finish it in one visit. You just won't. I met people there who've been coming back for years, and they're still finding new corners, new plants, new views.

That's the thing about real discovery, you know? It doesn't happen all at once. You have to keep showing up. Keep walking the paths. Keep staying curious.

Batumi Botanical Garden didn't just surprise me. It reminded me why I do this—why I keep moving, keep exploring. Because every place, if you give it time, if you really look... it'll teach you something you didn't know you needed to learn.

Trust me on this.
