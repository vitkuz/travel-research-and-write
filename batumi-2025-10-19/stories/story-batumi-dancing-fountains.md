## 🎬 Voiceover Script

### 1. Hook - The Dismissal (0:00-0:30)

Okay so. Dancing fountains. Dancing fountains in Batumi. When my friend told me about them, I was like... really? That's what we're doing tonight? I've seen fountains. Dubai fountains on Instagram, Vegas fountains on YouTube. They all do the same thing, right? Water goes up, water goes down, some lights, some music. Tourist trap stuff.

But it was free, and honestly I had nothing better to do. So I figured, why not. Let me tell you—I had no idea what I was walking into. No idea.

**Scene Notes:** Walking toward fountain area at dusk, skeptical expression

### 2. Arrival - First Impressions (0:30-1:15)

We got to Ardagani Lake around 9 PM. It's dark now, right? And there's already this crowd gathering. Families with kids on blankets, couples, solo travelers like me just... waiting. Everyone's got this anticipation thing going on. I'm standing there thinking, "Are we all here for dancing water?"

Then 9 o'clock hits. The music starts—and it's not some generic background track, it's Pavarotti. Like, actual Pavarotti. And these water jets, they just... they explode upward. Not just up though—they're spiraling, twisting, falling like rain. The lights hit them and suddenly it's not water anymore, it's liquid color moving through the air.

And I'm standing there going, "Okay, okay, this is actually kind of beautiful."

But then—then the lasers kicked in.

**Scene Notes:** Fountains begin, initial water choreography, crowd reactions

### 3. The Reveal - 3D Laser Show (1:15-2:15)

Three-dimensional lasers. I'm not talking about some basic light show pointing at the sky. These lasers were creating shapes—geometric patterns, spirals, tunnels of light you felt like you could walk through. The water jets are dancing to Pavarotti, the lights are changing colors with every musical shift, and these lasers are building structures in mid-air.

I literally stopped filming. Just stopped. I needed to actually watch this with my eyes, not through a screen. You know what I mean?

And here's the thing—it's completely free. Free. This quality, this production level—in Dubai or Vegas you'd pay like fifty bucks minimum. Here? Nothing. Zero. You just show up.

The show goes for like twenty minutes. Twenty minutes of pure synchronized artistry. Water soaring up, twisting in spirals, the lasers cutting through everything, Pavarotti hitting those high notes and the jets responding like they're feeling the music too.

I stayed for three shows. Three. Because every thirty minutes there's a new one with different music—Barry White, Sting, Diana Ross, Georgian traditional songs I've never heard but somehow felt in my chest.

**Scene Notes:** 3D laser effects, water spiraling, crowd entranced, multiple musical selections

### 4. The Atmosphere - Community Gathering (2:15-2:50)

But what got me—what really got me—wasn't just the show. It was the people around me.

Families sharing snacks they brought from home. This old Georgian couple dancing to Diana Ross right there on the viewing platform. Kids running around between shows, their parents not even stressed because everyone's relaxed, everyone's happy. Solo travelers like me catching each other's eyes like, "Are you seeing this?"

It felt like... I don't know, like this democratic moment. Like this thing that's genuinely for everyone. Not just tourists with money. Not just locals who know the secret spots. Everyone. All of us just standing together by the water, watching fountains dance to Pavarotti at 10 PM on a Tuesday.

That's rare. That feeling is rare.

**Scene Notes:** Families on blankets, couple dancing, communal atmosphere, diverse crowd

### 5. Reflection - What It Means (2:50-3:30)

I came expecting nothing. Less than nothing—I came expecting to be underwhelmed. To check it off some list and move on.

Instead I stayed until almost midnight. Watched show after show, each one somehow different, somehow moving in new ways. I bought churchkhela from a street vendor, sat on the stone wall by the lake, and just... existed. In that moment. With those people. With that music and those lights and that water doing things I didn't know water could do.

Sometimes the best experiences aren't the ones you plan. They're the ones you almost skip. The ones you show up to with zero expectations and they crack you open anyway.

Batumi's Dancing Fountains did that to me. They reminded me that magic doesn't have to cost anything. That beauty can be accessible. That a city can give something extraordinary to its people—and to strangers like me—just because.

You're in Batumi? Go. Seriously, go. Get there before 9 PM, grab a spot at Ardagani Lake, and let those fountains surprise you too. Trust me on this one.

**Scene Notes:** Night shots of fountains, Lilia sitting by the lake, final fountain flourish, crowd applause
