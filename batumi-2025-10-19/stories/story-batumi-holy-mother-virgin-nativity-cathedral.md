## 🎬 Voiceover Script

### 1. The Hook - Wait, What? (0:00-0:25)

Okay so I'm walking through Batumi, right? And I turn the corner and I just... stop. Dead stop.

There's this massive Gothic cathedral in front of me. Twin spires, pointed arches, stained glass—the whole thing. And my first thought is, "Did I accidentally walk into Poland? Where the hell am I?"

Because here's the thing—this is Georgia. Georgia. Orthodox churches here look like... well, like Orthodox churches. Domes, stone crosses, that distinct Georgian style. Not this. Not Gothic Revival architecture that belongs in Warsaw or Prague.

So naturally, I had to know what the hell was going on.

**Scene Notes:** Exterior shot, twin towers against sky, visible confusion/surprise in reaction

### 2. The Discovery - Layer One (0:25-1:10)

Turns out, this place was built in 1898. By two Georgian brothers—the Zubalashvilis—who commissioned a Polish architect named Aleksander Rogojski to design it. A Catholic church. In Georgia. Which is like, 80% Orthodox.

Already wild, right? But wait. Wait. It gets weirder.

I step inside and the light—oh my god, the light. Stained glass windows throwing these colors everywhere. Blues, reds, golds. The kind of light that makes you stop talking and just... breathe. Rib-vaulted ceilings stretching up like they're trying to touch heaven. It's stunning. Like genuinely stunning.

But then I notice the iconostasis. That gilded wall of icons. The frescoes of the Virgin Mary. Orthodox. This is an Orthodox cathedral now.

So I'm standing there thinking, "Okay, Catholic architecture. Orthodox interior. How did that happen?"

### 3. The History Twist - The Soviet Years (1:10-2:00)

Here's where it gets absolutely insane.

In the 1930s—Soviet times, anti-religion everywhere—they closed this cathedral. Shut it down. And you know what they turned it into? A physics laboratory. A physics lab. High-voltage experiments. In a cathedral.

I mean, come on. Can you imagine? Scientists in lab coats running voltage tests under stained glass windows depicting saints. It's like some kind of Soviet surrealist joke.

For decades, this building—this gorgeous Gothic masterpiece—was just... lab equipment. Wires. Machines. Science.

And somehow, somehow, the stained glass survived. The stone carvings survived. The whole building just... waited.

**Scene Notes:** Archival-style visuals if available, or focus on architectural details that survived

### 4. The Resurrection - 1989 (2:00-2:50)

Then 1989 hits. Perestroika. Everything's changing.

The Georgian Orthodox Church gets the building back. And on May 16th, 1989, Patriarch Elijah II consecrates it. Consecrates it. And here's the part that gets me—5,000 people got baptized that day. Five thousand. In one ceremony.

Think about that. After decades of Soviet atheism, state repression, fear—5,000 people showing up to publicly declare their faith. In a building that was literally a physics lab the year before.

The woman I talked to outside, she told me her grandmother was one of them. She said her grandmother cried the entire ceremony. Just cried and cried.

And I get it. I get it. This building isn't just architecture. It's survival. It's resistance. It's this crazy impossible story of transformation.

**Scene Notes:** People praying, candles, emotional close-ups, grandmother interview if possible

### 5. The Reflection - What It Means (2:50-3:30)

So now it's the seat of the bishop of Batumi. Active services every day. Divine Liturgy, baptisms, weddings. Tourists like me wandering in with cameras, locals coming in to pray. Both at the same time.

And honestly? It feels right. It feels alive.

This place has been Catholic. It's been Soviet. Now it's Orthodox. Three completely different identities in one building. And somehow, somehow, it works. The Gothic arches hold Orthodox icons. The European architecture houses Georgian faith.

Standing there in that colored light, I thought about how nothing is permanent, you know? Not governments, not ideologies, not even the purpose of buildings. Everything transforms. Everything adapts. Everything survives if it's built strong enough.

This cathedral was supposed to be destroyed. It should've been torn down in the Soviet years. But it wasn't. It survived as a lab. And then it became sacred again.

Maybe that's the real miracle. Not the architecture. Not even the 5,000 baptisms. Just... survival. Transformation. Coming back to life.

If you're in Batumi, go. Seriously. Go in the morning when the light hits those windows. Sit for a minute. Feel the weight of what this place has seen.

And maybe, like me, you'll leave thinking about what survives in us, too. What transforms. What comes back to life.
