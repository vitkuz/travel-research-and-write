## 🎬 Voiceover Script

### 1. Opening Hook - "Wait, What Is This Place?" (0:00-0:30)

Okay so, Miracle Park. Miracle Park. I'm standing here on Batumi's seafront boulevard, and I genuinely don't know where to look first. There's a 140-year-old lighthouse, a giant DNA helix covered in Georgian letters, a Ferris wheel, and... wait, is that tower literally dispensing free alcohol? Like, what even IS this place?

I came here thinking it's just another photo stop along the boulevard. You know, quick selfie, move on. But here's the thing - I've been here for two hours, and I'm not even close to done. Not even close.

**Scene Notes:** Wide establishing shot of park chaos, quick cuts between lighthouse, Alphabet Tower, Ali & Nino, Ferris wheel. Raw handheld energy, not polished.

### 2. The Realization - "This Isn't What I Expected" (0:30-1:15)

Let me tell you what they don't mention in the guidebooks. First - no entry fee. None. Zero. The park is just... open. 24/7, all year. I could come here at 3 AM if I wanted to, which honestly sounds amazing now that I think about it.

But it's not just free entry - there's free chacha. Actual free Georgian brandy dispensing from that tower over there. Every single day at 7 PM for exactly ten minutes. And I'm watching this crowd gather around it like it's some kind of daily ritual, locals and tourists all mixed together, and everyone's just... happy. Genuinely happy.

I wasn't expecting this. I was expecting a tourist trap. Maybe some overpriced rides, some generic sculptures. But this? This is something else entirely.

**Scene Notes:** Walking through park, showing mix of people. Close-up on Chacha Tower with gathered crowd. Genuine surprise reactions.

### 3. The Exploration - "Layer After Layer of Weird and Wonderful" (1:15-2:15)

So here's what you're actually getting in this one park. That lighthouse? Built by French engineers in 1882. Over 140 years old, standing right next to this ultra-modern moving sculpture called Ali and Nino - it's this tragic Georgian love story told through two steel figures that move toward each other, pass through each other, and separate. Every single day. And I'm watching it, and honestly... it's kind of heartbreaking.

Then there's the Alphabet Tower - 130 meters tall, shaped like DNA, covered in all 33 Georgian letters. Because why not, right? Why not just stick your entire alphabet on a tower and light it up at night?

And scattered everywhere - sculptures. "Woman on a bicycle," dolphins, Venus with angels. It's eclectic as hell. It shouldn't work. Like, theoretically, this combination of old lighthouse, modern art, amusement park, and free alcohol dispenser shouldn't work together. But somehow it does.

Evening hits, and the whole place transforms. Everything's illuminated - bright colors everywhere. The Ferris wheel is spinning with lights, the Alphabet Tower is glowing, and you can see the entire Black Sea stretched out in front of you.

**Scene Notes:** Montage of attractions. Lingering shots on Ali & Nino moving. Lighthouse against modern structures. Transition from day to illuminated evening. Pan across Black Sea view.

### 4. The Community - "Where Locals Actually Hang Out" (2:15-2:50)

Here's what surprised me most though. This isn't just for tourists. There are Georgian families here. Couples on dates. Groups of friends just sitting on benches, chatting, watching the sculptures. In summer, they do free concerts and festivals right here.

This is a real community space disguised as an amusement park. Or maybe it's an outdoor art museum disguised as entertainment. I honestly don't know anymore, and I don't think it matters.

That chacha dispensing at 7 PM? It's not a gimmick. It's a gathering. People come here for it every single day. It's become this thing, this ritual. And I'm part of it now, standing here with my little cup, toasting with complete strangers - "Gaumarjos!" - and everyone's laughing.

You know what though? I think that's the actual miracle of Miracle Park. It's not the attractions. It's that they made a space where Georgian history, modern creativity, and just... joy... all exist together without pretending to be something they're not.

**Scene Notes:** Shots of local families, couples, groups of friends. Chacha tasting ritual, clinking cups, laughing faces. Mix of ages and nationalities.

### 5. Closing Reflection - "The Kind of Surprise That Makes You Stay" (2:50-3:30)

I've been in Georgia for a while now, and I've learned that this country doesn't do anything halfway. They're extra in the best possible way. And Miracle Park is peak Georgian extra - giving you free chacha from a tower, sticking their alphabet on a DNA helix, keeping a 140-year-old lighthouse functioning while building modern art around it.

I came here planning to spend thirty minutes. I stayed for three hours. And honestly, I'll probably come back tomorrow. Because that's the thing about places like this - they don't just let you visit. They make you want to stay. They make you want to be part of whatever weird, wonderful thing they've created.

If you're in Batumi, don't just walk past this place for a quick photo. Stay. Watch Ali and Nino complete their tragic dance. Get your free chacha at 7 PM. Ride the Ferris wheel at sunset. Let yourself get lost in the beautiful chaos of it all.

Trust me on this one. Some miracles are actually real.

**Scene Notes:** Sunset shots from Ferris wheel showing entire park lit up. Final shot of Ali & Nino sculpture silhouetted against evening sky. Authentic, reflective energy.
