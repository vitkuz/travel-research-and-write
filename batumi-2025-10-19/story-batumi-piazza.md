## Voiceover Script

### 1. The Hook: Low Expectations (0:00-0:30)

Okay so, Batumi Piazza. I'm gonna be honest with you—when I first heard about it, I was like, "Great, another fake Italian square built for tourists." You know what I mean? Like, Georgia trying to do Venice or whatever. I've seen this before—cheap reconstructions, Instagram traps, those places you visit once for a photo and never think about again.

I walked in ready to be disappointed. Ready to just grab a coffee, take a quick photo, move on with my day.

I was so wrong. So, so wrong.

**Scene Notes:** Walking shots approaching the square, casual handheld camera, slightly skeptical expression

### 2. First Impressions Shift (0:30-1:15)

The first thing that hits you—it's gorgeous. Like, genuinely gorgeous. These buildings, the stained-glass windows, the architecture—it doesn't feel fake. And I'm standing there thinking, "Wait, when was this built?"

Turns out? 2010. Twenty-ten. This whole thing is newer than my first smartphone. But here's what got me—it doesn't feel new. There's this Italian architect, Vazha Orbeladze, and he was inspired by Florence's Piazza della Signoria. But he didn't just copy it, you know? He created something that feels both Georgian and Italian at the same time.

And then I looked down. I looked down at the ground.

And that's when everything changed.

**Scene Notes:** Slow pan across buildings, close-ups of stained-glass windows, camera tilting down to the mosaic floor

### 3. The Progressive Reveals (1:15-2:30)

There's this massive mosaic in the center of the square. 106 square meters. I'm walking on it, right? Taking photos. Pretty colors, nice design, cool mermaid in the middle.

But then I read the plaque.

Eighty-eight million, two hundred forty-four thousand, seven hundred thirty-five individual marble pieces. Eighty-eight million. Like, what? Each piece is one centimeter. One centimeter. Marble from fifteen different countries—fifteen—manufactured in Abu Dhabi by this company called Fantine Mosaic, shipped to Georgia, and assembled in ten days. Ten days!

I'm standing there doing the math in my head and it's just... it's insane, just insane.

This Georgian-Swiss designer, Natali de Pita Amirejibi, she created this whole underwater world. Five sea goddesses in different colors—red, blue, purple, pink, green. And that mermaid in the center? That's her daughter. Her daughter, Romina. She put her daughter in the center of Europe's largest figurative marble mosaic.

I mean, come on. That's not just art, that's love right there.

**Scene Notes:** Close-ups of mosaic details, walking footage examining different sections, hands touching the marble surface gently, emotional reaction shots

### 4. Deeper Discovery (2:30-3:00)

And the stained-glass windows—I almost missed them. I was so focused on the mosaic I almost walked past these massive stained-glass windows. Designed by Estonian artist Dolores Hoffman. Museum quality. Like, literal museum quality just hanging there in the open air.

This square, it's this whole international collaboration. Georgian architect. Georgian-Swiss designer. Estonian glass artist. Marble from fifteen countries. Manufacturing in Abu Dhabi. Assembly in Batumi.

And the crazy part? It works. It genuinely works. You sit here in the evening—restaurants, live music, cafes everywhere—and you forget you're in Georgia. But also, you don't forget. It's both places at once.

Placido Domingo performed here. Michel Legrand. World-class artists in a square that's barely fifteen years old.

**Scene Notes:** Looking up at stained-glass windows with dramatic backlighting, evening atmosphere shots with music and dining, cultural fusion moments

### 5. The Reflection: "You Have to See This" (3:00-3:30)

I came to Batumi Piazza expecting nothing. Maybe a quick coffee. Maybe a mediocre photo.

Instead, I spent three hours here. Three hours. Studying the mosaic. Talking to people. Eating khachapuri at a restaurant that somehow serves both Georgian food and perfect Italian espresso. Watching the clock figures move. Listening to someone play piano in the evening.

This place taught me something I keep forgetting—new doesn't mean fake. Recent doesn't mean shallow.

Sometimes the best stories aren't the ancient ones. Sometimes they're the ones being written right now, right under your feet, in eighty-eight million tiny pieces of marble.

If you're in Batumi and you skip this place because it's "just a tourist square," you're making the same mistake I almost made.

Trust me on this. Just... trust me.

**Scene Notes:** Golden hour lighting, reflective sitting-at-cafe shots, final wide shot of the entire square from above, ending on close-up of mosaic detail
