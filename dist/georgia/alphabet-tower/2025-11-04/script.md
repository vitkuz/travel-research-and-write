## HOOK (0:00 - 0:15)
### Visual: Wide shot of the gleaming Alphabet Tower against blue sky, then cut to inside the industrial freight elevator with confused expression

**VOICEOVER:**

Okay so, 66 million euros. That's what they spent on this tower. This futuristic monument celebrating the Georgian alphabet—one of only 14 unique writing systems in the entire world. Looks incredible from outside, right?

*[Beat, elevator doors opening to sparse interior]*

So why does it feel completely abandoned inside?

## ACT 1: SETUP - THE EXPECTATION (0:15 - 2:00)

### Visual: Montage of exterior shots—spiraling aluminum letters, DNA helix design, silver sphere at top, illuminated at night

**VOICEOVER:**

Here's the thing. When I first saw the Alphabet Tower from Batumi Boulevard, I was like... holy shit. This thing is 130 meters tall—that's basically a 40-story building—and it's covered in these massive 4-meter aluminum letters spiraling up like a double helix. Like DNA, you know? Because supposedly the Georgian alphabet is the genetic code of the nation.

I mean, that's poetic as hell.

*[Cut to walking toward tower entrance]*

I've been in Georgia for months now, trying to learn this insane alphabet. And trust me, it IS insane. 33 letters, no uppercase, looks like beautiful alien calligraphy. I can barely read it. So when I heard there's an entire tower dedicated to it—designed by a Spanish architect, constructed in just 14 months—I thought, okay, this is gonna be incredible. This is gonna teach me everything. Interactive exhibits, history, context, you know what I mean?

*[Walking shots along boulevard]*

Plus, there's a rotating restaurant on the third floor. Rotates 360 degrees in exactly one hour. And an observatory deck with views of the whole city and the Black Sea. And—get this—you can see this massive 50-ton tuned mass damper on the fifth floor. Same engineering they use in super-tall skyscrapers like Taipei 101 to stop the building from swaying in the wind.

*[Shot of tower entrance, checking phone for hours]*

I'm standing here at the entrance, and I'm excited. Like genuinely excited. This is exactly the kind of place I love—where architecture meets culture meets engineering. Where you learn something.

## ACT 2: THE REALITY HITS (2:00 - 5:30)

### Visual: Entry into tower, sparse lobby, utilitarian elevator

**VOICEOVER:**

So I walk in and... nothing. There's no one at the entrance. No tickets, no staff, no information desk. Just this empty lobby that feels half-finished.

*[Elevator doors opening]*

The elevator. Oh my god, the elevator. It's like a freight elevator from a construction site. No windows. No music. No lights. Just... metal walls and this grinding mechanical sound. I'm going up 130 meters in what feels like a moving storage container.

*[Elevator ascent, mechanical sounds]*

And I'm thinking, okay, maybe they're keeping it utilitarian on purpose. Maybe all the magic is upstairs.

*[Elevator doors open to empty floor]*

Nope.

*[Walking through sparse interior]*

There's nothing. No exhibits. No explanations. No plaques. No interactive displays about the alphabet's history, or how it's one of only 14 independent writing systems recognized by UNESCO in 2016. Nothing about the three distinct scripts—Asomtavruli, Nuskhuri, Mkhedruli. Nothing about why this matters.

Just empty floors and silence.

*[Cut to observatory deck, looking out windows]*

The views, okay, the views are stunning. I can see all of Batumi spread out below—the boulevard, the Black Sea stretching to the horizon, the Caucasus Mountains in the distance. Ships passing by. It's beautiful, it really is.

*[Reflection shot in window, confused expression]*

But I'm confused. Like genuinely confused. What is this place? Is it a monument? A restaurant? A TV studio? There's supposedly a studio on the second floor, but I didn't see it. Is this a cultural center or just an expensive viewing platform?

*[Walking toward restaurant level]*

The restaurant. Let me tell you about the Atmosphere Restaurant.

*[Interior of restaurant, empty or sparsely populated]*

It opens at 14:00, but the rotation—the whole selling point—only happens from 20:00 to midnight. So if you come during the day like I did, you're just sitting in a static room with windows. It's nice, don't get me wrong. But it's not rotating.

*[Sitting at table, waiting]*

And the service. Oh god. I'm sitting here for like 15 minutes and nobody acknowledges me. No menu, no water, no eye contact. I see other people sitting too, just waiting. Some guy across from me has been trying to flag down a server for like ten minutes.

*[Close-up of menu prices]*

When I finally get the menu, the prices are... yeah. High. Really high. Higher than ground-level restaurants in Batumi. Which makes sense, I guess—captive audience, novelty factor. But after waiting 20 minutes, I'm like, you know what? I'm not hungry anymore.

## ACT 3: THE SHIFT - FINDING MEANING (5:30 - 7:30)

### Visual: Walking to fifth floor, discovering the tuned mass damper

**VOICEOVER:**

But then. Here's what I didn't expect.

*[Fifth floor, massive 50-ton damper visible]*

I find the fifth floor. And there it is. This massive 50-ton tuned mass damper just... hanging there. This sophisticated piece of engineering that most people don't even know exists. It's basically this giant pendulum that counteracts the wind, keeps the tower from swaying. Same technology they use in the tallest buildings in the world.

*[Close-up shots of the damper mechanism]*

And I'm alone up here. Completely alone. Just me and this incredible machine. And for the first time since I entered the tower, I feel something. Not disappointment. Not confusion. Just... wonder.

*[Looking back at the mechanism]*

Nobody told me about this. It's not advertised. There's no sign saying "Hey, come see the engineering marvel on floor five." Most tourists probably skip it entirely. But it's here. Quietly doing its job. Keeping this whole structure stable.

*[Back at observatory deck, different time of day, golden hour light]*

I come back in the evening. Different vibe entirely. The sun is setting over the Black Sea, turning the water into liquid gold. The city lights are starting to flicker on below. And I'm thinking about what this tower actually is.

*[Exterior shot of illuminated tower at night]*

It cost 66 million euros to build. Took 14 months. Then Batumi City Hall couldn't afford the 700,000 GEL annual maintenance costs, so they leased it for 20 years to a Spanish company for 1 lari. That's like 36 cents. Thirty-six cents for a 66-million-euro monument.

*[Night shots of tower with Georgian script visible and illuminated]*

There were reports in 2014 of hundreds of dead birds found on the floors. Periods when the elevator didn't work. Times when it just sat here, closed, forsaken.

But it's still standing. Still illuminated every night. Still visible from everywhere in Batumi. These 33 aluminum letters still catching the light, still spiraling up toward that silver sphere.

## ACT 4: THE REFLECTION (7:30 - 8:30)

### Visual: Close-ups of Georgian letters on the tower exterior, then back to Lilia on the boulevard looking up at the tower

**VOICEOVER:**

Here's what I realized.

*[Walking away from tower on boulevard, looking back at it]*

This tower isn't about education. It's not a museum. It's not even really about the alphabet, not in the way I expected. It's a symbol. A bold, expensive, slightly absurd symbol of ambition. Of a country that wanted to celebrate its culture so badly that it built a 130-meter DNA helix and put its entire alphabet on it for the world to see.

*[Close-up of Georgian letters illuminated]*

And yeah, it's troubled. Yeah, it's operationally a mess. Yeah, it doesn't fulfill its potential. But you know what? That's kind of perfect for Georgia. This country that's constantly reinventing itself, constantly moving between past and future, constantly figuring out what it wants to be.

*[Sitting on boulevard bench, tower in background]*

I still can't read most of the alphabet. I still stumble over the letters. But now when I see them—in shop signs, on menus, scrawled in graffiti—I think about that tower. About those massive 4-meter letters spiraling toward the sky. About the fact that this writing system has survived 1,500 years and some architect thought it deserved a monument that looks like it's from the future.

*[Final exterior shot of tower, dusk/twilight]*

Locals don't really visit. They see it as governmental overspending. Tourists expect more. Everyone's kind of disappointed when they get inside.

But from the outside? At night? When it's lit up and the letters glow and the silver sphere catches the moonlight?

It's perfect.

*[Beat, looking directly at camera]*

I'm not gonna lie, I expected something totally different. I wanted interactive displays and guided tours and explanations. I wanted to learn. But what I got was this weird, beautiful, melancholy experience of a place that's trying so hard to be something meaningful and maybe failing but also... maybe not.

*[Walking away shot, tower in background getting smaller]*

Maybe that's the point. Maybe monuments aren't supposed to teach you. Maybe they're just supposed to make you feel something. Make you stop. Make you look up.

*[Final shot: tower at night, fully illuminated, Georgia subtitle appearing]*

And trust me, you can't not look at this thing.

## OUTRO (8:30 - 8:45)

### Visual: B-roll montage of tower from different angles, different times of day

**VOICEOVER:**

The Alphabet Tower. Georgian alphabet—UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage. 130 meters. 66 million euros. 36 cents in rent.

Worth seeing? Yeah. Worth going inside? Honestly... maybe just for the damper and the view.

But worth photographing from the boulevard at sunset?

Absolutely.
