## HOOK (0:00-0:15)
**[15 seconds]**

Okay so I'm standing at this cable car station in Batumi, and honestly? I thought this was gonna be some basic tourist trap, you know? Like, pay 30 lari, get five minutes of views, take your Instagram photo, leave.

But here's the thing. Here's the thing though.

I was so wrong.

## ACT 1: PRE-DEPARTURE ANXIETY & ARRIVAL (0:15-2:00)
**[1 minute 45 seconds]**

### Setting Expectations (0:15-0:45)
**[30 seconds]**

So I've been living in Georgia for a while now, right? And every time I walk past this cable car near the harbor, I'm like... that's for tourists. That's not for me. I'm too busy, too broke, I've got work to do. Thirty lari just to go up a mountain? I can see mountains for free, thanks.

But then my friend Natia—Georgian friend, local, born and raised here—she's like, "Lilia, you're being stupid. Just go. Trust me."

And I'm thinking, what am I gonna see? Some views? I've seen views. I've been to thirty countries. Views don't excite me anymore.

Or so I thought.

### Getting the Ticket (0:45-1:15)
**[30 seconds]**

It's a Wednesday afternoon. I specifically came on a Wednesday because I cannot deal with crowds, I just can't. And okay, there's barely a line. Like ten people ahead of me, max. Thirty lari for a round trip. I hand over the money and I'm already calculating—that's like two dinners of khinkali, that's three days of marshrutka rides, that's—

Stop it, Lilia. Just stop it. You're allowed to do tourist shit sometimes.

The gondola pulls up. This sleek, enclosed cabin. Austrian-made, apparently. Doppelmayr. I don't know what that means but it sounds expensive and German-engineered or whatever. Eight people can fit. Right now it's just me, a Georgian family with two kids, and an older couple speaking Russian.

### The First Moments (1:15-2:00)
**[45 seconds]**

The door closes. We start moving. And immediately—immediately—I feel this weird calm wash over me. The hum of the cable. The gentle sway. We're gliding, not jerking. Five meters per second, they said. I don't know what that means in normal human terms but it feels... smooth. Safe.

The little kids are pressing their faces against the window, pointing down at the streets below. "Mama, look! Our building! I see our building!"

And I'm looking too. Looking down at Batumi spreading out beneath us. First we're passing over the harbor area. Boats. Cranes. Those industrial vibes. Then residential blocks start appearing below us.

This is where it gets weird.

## ACT 2: THE JOURNEY - DISCOVERING LAYERS (2:00-6:30)
**[4 minutes 30 seconds]**

### Intimate Views of Real Life (2:00-3:15)
**[1 minute 15 seconds]**

We're maybe fifty meters up now. And I can see into people's lives. Like, literally into their balconies. There's laundry hanging—bright yellow towels, someone's jeans, a floral bedsheet flapping in the wind. There's a woman watering plants on her tiny balcony. There's a rooftop where someone's set up a whole little garden with tomatoes growing in pots.

You know what I mean? This isn't the Batumi you see in tourism ads. This isn't the boulevard, the modern skyscrapers, the fancy hotels. This is real people. Living. Existing. Going about their Wednesday afternoon not knowing some random nomad from Siberia is flying overhead thinking about their tomato plants.

I love this. I actually love this.

We pass over a neighborhood market. I can see the colorful tarps, vendors arranging vegetables, customers haggling. The smell—you can't smell it from up here but I know that smell—fresh herbs, ripe peaches, that slightly fishy scent from the seafood section.

This fifteen-minute ride—yeah, fifteen minutes, not five—it's showing me Batumi in layers I never noticed from the ground.

### The Black Sea Reveal (3:15-4:30)
**[1 minute 15 seconds]**

We're higher now. Way higher. The Black Sea is expanding to my left, this endless blue-grey expanse stretching to the horizon. And I'm not gonna lie, it takes my breath away. Just takes it.

The sun is hitting the water at this angle where it looks like liquid silver. Like someone poured melted metal across the surface. The Georgian family next to me has gone quiet too. Even the kids. We're all just... looking.

And here's what hits me. Here's what actually hits me standing—well, sitting—in this gondola suspended 200-something meters above the ground. I've been so focused on survival mode since I got to Georgia. Finding apartments, dealing with landlords, managing my translation work, worrying about money, about visas, about where I'll be in six months.

I forgot to actually look at where I am.

Like, really look.

### The Mountain Transition (4:30-5:30)
**[1 minute]**

We're passing over the edge of the city now. Buildings give way to green. Thick green forest climbing up the mountain. The Caucasus Mountains, man. I still can't get over them. I'm from Siberia—I know mountains—but there's something about these Georgian mountains. They're lush. Alive. Ancient.

The cable is carrying us higher. I can see the upper station now, this pavilion that looks like—I shit you not—like a ship. Like we're sailing through the sky toward this ship perched on the mountain.

The Argo. The mythical ship from the Jason and the Argonauts story. These Georgians, they really commit to their mythology. This whole region was ancient Colchis where Jason came for the Golden Fleece. Three thousand years of history and they're like, "Yeah, let's build our cable car station to look like that legendary ship."

Honestly? I respect it.

### Arrival at the Summit (5:30-6:30)
**[1 minute]**

The gondola slows down. We're approaching the upper station. The door opens and—

Okay. Okay, hold on.

I thought this was just gonna be like, a viewing platform. Maybe a little cafe selling overpriced coffee. That's it. That's what I expected.

But I step out and there's... there's a whole complex up here. Multiple levels. A restaurant—like a proper restaurant with tablecloths and everything. Open-air terraces. Shopping units. Entertainment zones. Music playing. The smell of khachapuri baking somewhere.

And people. Lots of people but it doesn't feel crowded. They're spread out across different platforms, different levels. Families. Couples. Groups of Georgian teenagers taking selfies.

This is not what I expected. This is not what I expected at all.

## ACT 3: THE SUMMIT EXPERIENCE - SURPRISES (6:30-8:45)
**[2 minutes 15 seconds]**

### The View Platform (6:30-7:30)
**[1 minute]**

I walk to the main viewing platform. And I just... I stop.

360-degree views. Three-sixty. The Black Sea to the west, sparkling, massive, infinite. Batumi below, the whole city laid out like a map. I can see the Ali and Nino statue from up here—those two figures that move and merge every day. I can see the Alphabet Tower. The skyscrapers of the New Boulevard. The old town with its traditional architecture.

And turning around—the mountains. Layers and layers of green peaks extending north and east. The Lesser Caucasus. I can see maybe thirty kilometers in every direction. On the southern horizon, that's Turkey. Like, literally Turkey. The border's right there.

A woman next to me, probably in her sixties, Georgian, she sees me staring and she smiles. "First time?" she asks in Georgian.

"Yeah," I say. "I've lived here for months and I never came."

She laughs. "We came eleven times. Every time family visits, we bring them here. Never gets old."

Eleven times. She's been here eleven times and she's back again.

### The Cultural Surprise (7:30-8:45)
**[1 minute 15 seconds]**

I'm walking around the complex and I hear singing. Traditional Georgian polyphonic singing. UNESCO heritage stuff—these harmonies that sound like they're coming from another dimension, another time.

I follow the sound and there's this group performing. Not for tourists—like, not in a cheesy way. This is real. Professional dancers in traditional costumes. The singers are doing that polyphonic thing where multiple melodic lines interweave and it sounds like magic. Literal magic.

It's 7:45 PM. They do this every evening at 8 PM during summer months, apparently. For free. Just included.

And I'm standing there watching and I feel something crack open in my chest. You know that feeling? When something unexpectedly beautiful just hits you and you're like, oh. Oh, this is why I travel. This is why I keep moving. For moments like this. Unplanned. Unscripted. Just... real.

There's a wine tasting happening in the corner. Fifteen lari. Georgian wine made in those ancient qvevri clay vessels buried underground. Eight thousand years of winemaking tradition. The woman running it is explaining the process in Georgian, Russian, and broken English to a group of tourists.

This cable car—this thing I dismissed as a tourist trap—it's actually a cultural center. A real one.

---

## ACT 4: REFLECTION & DESCENT (8:45-9:15)
**[30 seconds]**

I stay up there for almost two hours. Two hours. Just wandering. Watching the sunset turn the sky orange and purple and the sea turns gold. Watching Batumi's lights start twinkling on below like someone's sprinkling stars across the city.

When I finally get back in the gondola for the descent, it's almost dark. The ride down is quieter. Softer. The city is illuminated now. Everything looks different at night. Magical, even.

I'm sharing the cabin with a young couple—tourists, maybe German or Dutch—and they're snuggled together, quiet, just watching.

And I'm thinking... I almost didn't do this. I almost skipped this because I was too proud, too "local," too cheap, too busy.

---

## OUTRO: CLOSING THOUGHTS (9:15-9:30)
**[15 seconds]**

Here's what I learned on that fifteen-minute cable car ride, and the two hours I spent at the top, and the fifteen minutes back down.

Sometimes the tourist things? They're tourist things for a reason. Sometimes the locals are right. Sometimes you need to stop calculating costs and just... go. Experience. Let yourself be surprised.

The Argo Cable Car isn't just about views. It's about perspective. It's about seeing where you are—really seeing it—from a completely different angle.

Trust me on this. Just go.
