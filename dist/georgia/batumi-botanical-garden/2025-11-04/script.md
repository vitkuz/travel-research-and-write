## HOOK (0:00-0:15)

### Visual
- Quick cuts: Me struggling uphill, sweat dripping, breathing heavy
- Wide shot: Massive hillside garden cascading to Black Sea
- Close-up: My exhausted but amazed face
- Sign showing "5.5 km route"

### Audio (Voiceover)

Okay so... *breathing heavy* ...nobody told me this place was basically a mountain hike disguised as a garden. Like, literally nobody.

I thought I was going to look at some flowers for an hour. Maybe take some nice photos, you know? 

It's been three hours. Three hours. I'm still not done. And honestly? I'm not even mad about it.

## ACT 1: SETUP - THE EXPECTATION (0:15-2:00)

### Visual
- Morning shots of me in Batumi, looking at garden brochure
- Marshrutka #31 ride (interior, window views)
- Arrival at entrance, buying ticket (20 GEL exchange)
- Me holding confusing paper map, looking puzzled
- Garden entrance sign, other tourists entering

### Audio (Voiceover)

Here's the thing about Batumi. Everyone talks about the boulevard, the Ali and Nino statue, that cable car thing. But I kept seeing this botanical garden mentioned like, "oh yeah, if you have time."

If you have time. Ha.

So I'm like, sure, I'll go check out some plants. I mean, how big can it be, right? It's a garden.

*pause, self-deprecating laugh*

So stupid. So, so stupid.

I take the marshrutka—number 31, costs like 50 tetri, which is basically nothing—and it drops me right at the entrance. And I'm standing there, looking at this map they gave me, and I cannot make sense of it. Like, at all.

The woman at the ticket booth sees me staring at it like it's written in hieroglyphics and she just... she laughs. She laughs at me. Points up the hill and says something in Georgian I don't understand, but the vibe was definitely like, "Good luck, you're gonna need it."

Twenty lari to get in. That's like, what, seven bucks? Cheap. Seemed like a good deal.

Turns out it's cheap because you're paying to climb a fucking mountain.

---

## ACT 2: THE JOURNEY - UNEXPECTED REALITY (2:00-7:00)

### BEAT 1: The First Climb (2:00-3:15)

#### Visual
- Me walking uphill on paved path
- Bamboo forest close-ups, creaking sounds
- Sweat visible, adjusting backpack
- First sea view reveal through trees
- Wide panorama shot

#### Audio (Voiceover)

So I start walking. And immediately—immediately—it's uphill. Like, proper uphill.

But then I enter this bamboo forest and... okay, you know what? The sound. The sound of bamboo. It creaks. Like, actually creaks in the wind. And I'm surrounded by these stalks that are, I don't know, thirty meters tall? Towering over me.

And it's quiet except for that. The creaking. The birds. The distant sound of the sea somewhere below me.

I'm starting to sweat already, it's humid as hell, but I'm not thinking about that because suddenly the path opens up and—

*sharp inhale*

—there's the Black Sea. Just right there. Infinite blue cutting through all this green.

And I'm standing there like an idiot, just staring. Because this is not what I expected. Not at all.

This isn't some nice garden. This is... this is something else.

### BEAT 2: Getting Lost in Geography (3:15-4:30)

#### Visual
- Sign showing "East Asia" zone
- Then "Mediterranean" zone  
- Japanese Garden: red bridges, bonsai trees, stone lanterns
- Me touching ancient bonsai carefully
- Fountain with frogs
- Quick cut to Mexico section signage
- Me looking confused at map again

#### Audio (Voiceover)

Here's what's wild. This place is divided into nine different geographic zones. Nine. Like, you walk through East Asia, then suddenly you're in the Mediterranean, then you're in the Himalayas.

I find the Japanese Garden and I just... I stop. Because there are bonsai trees here that are over a hundred years old. A hundred years. They survived the Soviet Union, they survived wars, they survived everything.

And they're just here, in Georgia, on the Black Sea coast, looking like they were plucked straight out of Kyoto.

There are these little red bridges and stone lanterns and this peaceful valley with fountains and frogs croaking and I'm sitting on a bench under this gazebo thinking, "How is this real?"

Then I check the map—still makes no sense—and I see there's a Mexico section. And I'm like, okay, I have to see that.

Turns out Mexico is where the guy who founded this place is buried. 

His name was Andrey Krasnov. Russian botanist. He opened this garden in 1912 and died two years later. Two years. Didn't even get to see what it would become.

And his grave is just there, in the Mexican section, surrounded by the plants he collected. And I don't know, man... that hit me. That really hit me.

He knew he was dying and he still did this.

### BEAT 3: The Physical Reality (4:30-5:30)

#### Visual
- My feet on steep trail, breathing audible
- Other tourists also struggling, shared looks
- Electric car passing me on path
- Me drinking water, checking phone for time
- Elevation/distance markers
- Wider shot showing scale of hillside

#### Audio (Voiceover)

Okay but let's be real for a second. This place is hard.

Like, I'm in decent shape, I walk everywhere, but this is 5.5 kilometers of uphill-downhill-uphill climbing. In humidity. With elevation gain that my legs are definitely feeling.

I see people hiring these electric cars—costs like 10 lari—and honestly, no judgment. If you have mobility issues, you need that. This is not wheelchair accessible. Like, at all.

I pass this Georgian family having a full picnic on the hillside. They've got khachapuri, wine, kids running around. And I realize... this isn't a tourist site to them. This is just where they come on weekends.

That's when it clicks. This place isn't trying to be perfect or polished or Instagram-ready. It's a public park. It's a research station. It's a wilderness preserve.

The plants aren't in perfect little beds. They're growing semi-wild. And that's the whole point.

I wanted flowers. I got a forest.

And honestly? I got the better deal.

### BEAT 4: The Secret Beach (5:30-6:30)

#### Visual
- Trail leading down toward coast
- Railway tracks visible below
- Hidden beach through rocks
- Me climbing down carefully
- Small secluded cove
- Black Sea waves
- Me sitting on beach, looking back up at garden

#### Audio (Voiceover)

So here's something nobody tells you.

There's a beach. Inside the garden. Well, not inside exactly, but connected. There's this hidden cove thing behind some rocks near the north entrance.

And you can just... go down there. Go swimming. Then walk back up into the garden.

I find this out because I literally hear the train. The coastal railway runs right below the garden, and I'm like, "Wait, why do I hear a train?"

So I follow the sound and suddenly I'm on this tiny beach, completely surrounded by cliffs, and there's like three other people here and that's it.

And I sit down on these rocks and I look back up at the garden, at this massive hillside jungle I've been climbing through, and the scale of it finally makes sense.

This isn't 108 hectares of garden. This is 108 hectares of different entire worlds stacked on top of each other.

East Asia. The Mediterranean. The Himalayas. The Caucasus. North America. Australia.

All of it, right here, tumbling down to the sea.

It's insane. Just insane.

### BEAT 5: The Honey (6:30-7:00)

#### Visual
- Steep climb to apiary
- Beekeepers working
- Close-up of honey jars
- Me tasting honey, genuine reaction
- Beekeeper explaining (subtitled if speaking Georgian)
- Jars of different colored honey

#### Audio (Voiceover)

By the time I climb—and I mean climb—to this apiary at the top of one of the trails, I'm exhausted. Properly exhausted.

But there are beekeepers there, and they're selling honey. And one of them sees my face, all red and sweaty, and just hands me a spoon with honey on it.

And I taste it and...

Okay, I've had honey before, right? But this is different. This is different because the bees are collecting from like 2,000 different plant species. Two thousand. All in this tiny area.

The flavor is... I can't even describe it. It's floral but also earthy but also bright? It tastes like the whole garden somehow.

The beekeeper tries to explain to me in broken English how different plants bloom at different times, how the honey changes flavor by season. And I'm just nodding, still tasting, still trying to process.

I buy two jars. One for me, one for my friend in Tbilisi.

Totally worth the climb.

## ACT 3: CLIMAX - THE REALIZATION (7:00-8:30)

### Visual
- Sunset light filtering through leaves
- Me at highest panoramic viewpoint
- Full garden vista below
- Black Sea stretching to horizon
- Caucasus mountains in distance
- Close-up of my face, genuine emotion
- Slow pan across landscape

### Audio (Voiceover)

I make it to the highest viewpoint just as the light is starting to change. That golden hour thing, you know?

And from up here, I can see the whole thing. The whole garden spread out below me, this cascade of green dropping down to the sea. The Caucasus mountains behind me. The Black Sea in front, going on forever.

And I'm thinking about Krasnov. About how he knew he was dying and he still planted all this. How he imagined it but never really got to see it grown.

And I'm thinking about those hundred-year-old bonsai trees that survived everything.

And the Georgian families picnicking on hillsides like this is just their Sunday.

And the secret beach hidden behind rocks.

And the honey that tastes like 2,000 flowers.

*long pause*

I came here thinking I'd spend an hour looking at plants.

I've been here for four hours. Four and a half, maybe.

And I still don't want to leave.

Here's the thing though. Here's what I realized standing up here.

This place isn't about plants. I mean, it is—it's a botanical garden, obviously. But that's not what it's really about.

It's about this guy's dream that outlived him. It's about nature being allowed to be a little wild even in a garden. It's about Georgians treating it like their backyard instead of some precious untouchable museum.

It's about the fact that you can climb through nine different continents in one afternoon and end up on a secret beach and taste honey that exists nowhere else in the world.

*voice gets quieter, more emotional*

I've been to a lot of places. A lot. Thirty countries in nine years, constantly moving, constantly searching for... I don't even know what.

But sometimes—not always, but sometimes—you find a place that just stops you. Makes you slow down. Makes you feel something real.

This is one of those places.

And nobody told me. It was just... "if you have time, check out the botanical garden."

If you have time.

*laughs, a bit choked up*

Make the time. Trust me. Make the time.

## OUTRO (8:30-10:00)

### Visual
- Me walking back down as sun sets
- Garden slowly emptying
- Lights turning on along paths
- Me at exit, exhausted but smiling
- Marshrutka ride back, looking out window
- Final shot: Garden from distance, lights glowing on hillside

### Audio (Voiceover)

So, practical stuff real quick before my phone dies.

Take marshrutka 31 from Batumi, 50 tetri. Entrance is 20 lari for foreigners, 10 for Georgians. Bring water. Bring snacks. Wear actual hiking shoes, not sandals—I saw people in flip-flops and just... no. Don't.

The map they give you is useless. Just follow the main paths and let yourself get a little lost. That's where the good stuff is anyway.

Go early morning or late afternoon. Avoid midday heat. Give yourself at least three hours minimum. Four is better.

And if you can, stay in one of the little villages nearby—Chakvi or Tsikhisdziri—instead of Batumi. The homestays are cheap and the hosts are amazing and they'll tell you all the secret spots.

Buy the honey from the apiary. Just do it.

*pause*

I'm exhausted. I'm sweaty. My legs are gonna hurt tomorrow.

And I'm already thinking about when I can come back.

*soft laugh*

This is what I'm talking about. This is why I do this whole nomad thing. Not for the Instagram shots or the travel vlogs or whatever.

For moments like this. For places that surprise you. For dead botanists' dreams that turn into living forests.

For honey that tastes like 2,000 flowers.

*camera focusing on garden lights in distance as night falls*

Georgia keeps doing this to me, man. Keeps showing me stuff I wasn't expecting.

Keeps making me want to stay.

*fade to black*
