## HOOK (0:00-0:15)

**[VISUAL: Wide shot of Lilia standing at northern end of boulevard, palms swaying, Black Sea behind her, early morning golden light]**

Okay so. Seven kilometers. Seven. That's what the sign says. And I'm standing here thinking—who the hell walks seven kilometers along a beach promenade? Like, why would you do that?

**[VISUAL: Quick cuts - colonnade flash, kinetic sculpture spinning, fountains, people everywhere]**

Turns out... everyone. Literally everyone in Batumi. And by the end of this day? I get it. I totally get it.

---

## ACT 1: SETUP - First Impressions (0:15-2:00)

**[VISUAL: Lilia walking slowly, taking in surroundings, touching palm trees, looking confused at the mix of architecture]**

Here's the thing about Batumi Boulevard—and I wasn't expecting this at all—it's not some touristy waterfront like you'd see in, I don't know, Barcelona or Nice. Though they literally used to call this place "little Nice" back in the day. Which is wild because it's nothing like that now.

**[VISUAL: Close-up of pebble beach, wider shot showing Soviet colonnades next to modern glass towers]**

It's this completely insane architectural hodgepodge. Like, you've got these white Greek colonnades from the 1930s—imported from Italy, by the way—and right next to them? Glass towers. Soviet mosaics. French-style gardens from 1881. And this massive kinetic sculpture of two people that move. I'm standing here and I'm like... this shouldn't work. This should be visual chaos.

**[VISUAL: Lilia gesturing at the eclectic mix]**

But somehow? Somehow it does. It's beautiful in this really weird, unplanned way. Like layers of history that nobody bothered to erase. They just... kept adding.

**[VISUAL: Checking phone GPS, looking at the distance ahead]**

So, seven kilometers. Old Boulevard at this end, New Boulevard way down south. I've got the whole day. Let's see if I make it.

## ACT 2: THE JOURNEY - Morning to Afternoon (2:00-6:00)

### BEAT 1: The Colonnades & History (2:00-3:00)

**[VISUAL: Walking through the white colonnades, running hand along columns]**

These colonnades, right? Built in 1934. And here's a crazy story—a local doctor brought the project back from Italy with help from Maxim Gorky. Yeah, THE Maxim Gorky. Soviet writer. Because apparently even during communism, Batumi was like, "We need elegant Italian architecture on our seaside."

**[VISUAL: Circular colonnade in 6 May Park, then rectangular one]**

There's two of them. The circular one here in this park, and that rectangular one over there, which used to mark the entrance back when the coastline was closer. The sea was literally right there. Now it's hundreds of meters away because they kept extending the shoreline.

**[VISUAL: Lilia sitting on steps, watching elderly Georgian couple walk by arm in arm]**

What I love though—what I really love—is watching the locals. This isn't a tourist promenade. This is where Georgians come. Every single evening. It's like a ritual. You get dressed up, you walk, you see people, you're seen. It's a whole social thing.

And I'm just this random Siberian girl sitting here, and I feel... I don't know. Welcomed? Like I'm part of something without anyone needing to invite me.

### BEAT 2: The Pebble Beach Reality (3:00-4:15)

**[VISUAL: Walking down to the beach, shoes off, walking on pebbles, grimacing slightly]**

Okay, real talk. This entire seven-kilometer coastline? Pebbles. All pebbles. No sand.

**[VISUAL: Close-up of colorful pebbles, then wide shot of beach]**

And at first I was like, "Ugh, this is gonna suck for swimming." Because, you know, pebbles hurt. They're uncomfortable. But then I started noticing something.

**[VISUAL: Local Georgian man in work clothes rolls up pants, walks into water for quick swim, comes out 10 minutes later]**

Locals don't treat the beach like... a destination. They just pop in. Quick swim between errands. There's public showers everywhere—completely free—so people just spontaneously decide to swim. No beach bags, no planning, no whole production.

**[VISUAL: Lilia at public shower, locals rinsing off]**

And the water? Crystal clear. Because pebbles don't cloud it up like sand does. The Black Sea here in summer hits like 27, 28 degrees Celsius. Which is insane. It's warm. It's genuinely warm.

**[VISUAL: Lilia dipping hand in water, genuine surprise on face]**

I'm not gonna lie, I came here thinking "Black Sea, sounds cold, sounds industrial." Nope. Wrong. Completely wrong.

### BEAT 3: The Chaos of Details (4:15-5:30)

**[VISUAL: Montage of discoveries - zoo animals, Neptune fountain, sculptures, table tennis tables]**

So as I'm walking, I keep finding these things that make no sense but also make perfect sense.

There's a zoo. A zoo. Right here in the park. With zebras and kangaroos. Over 140 animals just chilling as part of the public space. Local kids don't go "to the zoo"—they just see the zebra on their evening walk.

**[VISUAL: Free ping pong tables, people playing intensely]**

Free ping pong tables everywhere. And people bring their own paddles. Like serious paddles. This isn't casual—people are competing. Strangers join in. It's this spontaneous social thing.

**[VISUAL: The quirky Batumi Octopus cafe with Soviet mosaic exterior]**

And then there's this cafe shaped like an octopus. Soviet-era mosaic. Still there. Still serving food. The whole building is covered in sea creature art and it's kind of amazing in a totally absurd way.

**[VISUAL: Lilia laughing, shaking head]**

This place, I swear. This place doesn't follow any rules.

### BEAT 4: Human Connection (5:30-6:00)

**[VISUAL: Lilia at small cafe, older Georgian woman brings her coffee without ordering]**

I stopped at this tiny cafe around kilometer three because my feet were starting to hurt and I just needed to sit.

**[VISUAL: Close-up of Georgian coffee, warm interaction with cafe owner]**

The woman running it—I didn't order anything, she just brought me coffee. And not like "here's your coffee, that'll be 5 lari," but like... sat with me for a second. Asked where I'm from. Nodded when I said Siberia like that explained everything.

**[VISUAL: Lilia's face, genuine emotion]**

And it hit me right then. It hit me that this boulevard, this seven-kilometer stretch, isn't about what's here. It's about who's here. The people using this space every single day like it's their living room.

I've been a nomad for nine years. Nine. And sometimes you forget that places aren't just backdrops for your travel content. They're homes for people. Real homes. And I'm just passing through.

**[VISUAL: Lilia looking around at families, couples, elderly people walking]**

But for this moment? I'm part of it. And that means something.

---

## ACT 3: EVENING - The Transformation (6:00-8:30)

### BEAT 5: Ali and Nino Sculpture (6:00-7:15)

**[VISUAL: Walking toward Ali and Nino, sun starting to set, golden hour lighting]**

By kilometer five or six—honestly I lost track—I reach this sculpture everyone talks about. Ali and Nino.

**[VISUAL: Wide shot of the 8-meter steel figures starting their cycle]**

Two figures, eight meters tall, made of steel. And every ten minutes they move toward each other, merge into one, then separate again. It's this Georgian artist's take on eternal love.

**[VISUAL: Crowd gathering, people with phones out, couples holding hands]**

What gets me though—what really gets me—is watching everyone else watch it. There's this crowd that gathers every single time. Every ten minutes. And people help each other get photos. Strangers. Just helping each other capture the moment when the figures merge.

**[VISUAL: Couple getting engaged during the merge, crowd applauding]**

And then—I kid you not—this couple gets engaged. Right there. Right during the merge moment. And everyone applauds. Everyone. Complete strangers applauding this couple's engagement because we all witnessed it together.

**[VISUAL: Lilia wiping eyes, laughing at herself]**

I'm crying. Like actually crying. I wanted to keep this short but nope, got emotional. Because this? This is why I do this crazy nomad shit. Not for perfect Instagram moments. For real ones. Real ones like this.

### BEAT 6: Evening Promenade Culture (7:15-8:30)

**[VISUAL: The boulevard filling up with people as evening sets in, lights coming on]**

So here's what happens around 6, 7 PM. The entire boulevard transforms.

**[VISUAL: Families dressed up, couples in nice clothes, elderly people in elegant attire]**

People get dressed up. Like, properly dressed up. This isn't "I'm going for a walk in my gym clothes." This is "I'm going to be seen by my entire community and I'm going to look good."

**[VISUAL: Walking through the evening crowd, cafes packed]**

The cafes burst into life. Outdoor seating completely full. Everyone's lingering over wine and coffee. There's street musicians. Artists painting. The dancing fountains start at 9 PM with laser shows that run until 2 AM. 2 AM!

**[VISUAL: Dancing fountains beginning their show, music and lights]**

And the whole thing is free. Completely free. No entry fees, no paid zones, nothing. This is what public space should be.

**[VISUAL: Lilia walking slowly, taking it all in]**

I've walked seven kilometers today. My feet are killing me. I'm exhausted. But I get it now. I totally get why everyone does this.

**[VISUAL: Close-up of Lilia's face, genuine reflection]**

It's not about the exercise. It's not even really about the scenery, though that's beautiful. It's about being part of something. Part of this nightly ritual where everyone in Batumi comes together, walks the same path, sees the same sunset, experiences the same space.

**[VISUAL: Wide shot from above showing the boulevard lit up, stretching into distance]**

There's this thing I've learned—after living in eight countries, after moving constantly for nine years. Home isn't a place you find. It's a feeling you create. It's knowing which cafe makes your coffee right, recognizing faces, having routines.

**[VISUAL: Lilia sitting on bench, watching people pass]**

And for the people here? This boulevard is that feeling. Every single evening. It's their home.

---

## OUTRO: REFLECTION (8:30-9:30)

**[VISUAL: Lilia at southern end of boulevard, New Boulevard, night fully set in, city lights reflecting on water]**

So. Seven kilometers. From Old Boulevard to New Boulevard. From 1881 German landscape design to 2010 kinetic sculptures. From morning calm to evening celebration.

**[VISUAL: Looking back along the path just walked]**

I started this morning thinking this was just a long seaside promenade. Nice but, you know, how different can it be from any other boardwalk?

**[VISUAL: Montage of key moments from the day - colonnades, pebble beach, cafe owner, Ali and Nino, evening crowds]**

Turns out completely different. Because this place—this seven-kilometer stretch—it's alive. Like actually alive with real community, real rituals, real connection.

**[VISUAL: Lilia's face, tired but genuinely happy]**

And maybe that's what I've been searching for all these years as a nomad. Not the next destination, not the next Instagram shot. But places where life is still... lived. Where people gather not because they have to, but because they want to. Because it matters.

**[VISUAL: Final wide shot of boulevard at night, people still walking, fountains still dancing]**

Batumi Boulevard isn't just a tourist attraction. It's a masterclass in how public space should work. Accessible, beautiful, free, alive.

**[VISUAL: Lilia starting to walk back, then turning to camera one last time]**

Seven kilometers. Walk it if you come here. All of it. Don't take the marshrutka back. Just walk.

Because it's not about getting from one end to the other. It's about everything that happens in between.

**[VISUAL: Fade to black with text overlay]**

Free, 24/7, Open to All

### Authenticity Elements (Lilia's Voice):
✓ First-person perspective throughout
✓ Stream-of-consciousness topic jumps
✓ Raw emotional moments (crying at Ali and Nino)
✓ Self-aware commentary ("I wanted to keep it short but nope")
✓ Repetition for emphasis ("I get it. I totally get it")
✓ Direct address to viewer ("Here's the thing...", "Real talk")

✓ Sensory details (pebbles, water temperature, coffee)
✓ Human connection highlighted (cafe owner, engagement crowd)
