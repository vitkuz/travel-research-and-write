  "description": "Batumi Piazza is a charming 5,700-square-meter Italian-style public square nestled in the heart of Old Batumi, Georgia. Completed in 2010, this architectural gem was designed by Georgian architect Vazha Orbeladze, who drew inspiration from Italy's iconic Piazza della Signoria in Florence, despite the square being named after Venice's Piazza San Marco. The plaza represents a modern interpretation of Venetian architecture seamlessly integrated into one of Batumi's most historic districts, creating the illusion of a small Italian town on Georgia's Black Sea coast. The centerpiece of the square is Europe's largest figurative marble mosaic, measuring 106 square meters and comprised of 88,244,735 individual pieces, each one square centimeter, combined into 1,764,895 segments. Created by Georgian-Swiss designer Natalia de Pita Amirejibi in 2010, the mosaic features five female sea deities in a composition of eight concentric circles representing the eternal motion of the sea and continuous urban development. The square is surrounded by buildings constructed in 2009 featuring stunning stained-glass windows by renowned Estonian artist Dolores Hoffmann, intricate facades, and a magnificent clock tower that now houses a boutique hotel. Since opening, Batumi Piazza has become the city's premier venue for cultural and entertainment events, hosting world-famous musicians including Placido Domingo, Sting, Chris Botti, Macy Gray, and Michel Legrand.",

  "tips": [
    "Visit late afternoon for coffee at outdoor cafes or after sunset for live music and wine, when the decorative lighting transforms the square into an even cozier, more atmospheric space.",

    "Arrive between May and September for the best experience, when warm weather brings open-air concerts, vibrant street performances, and local festivals to the square.",

    "Visit on Sunday mornings to browse markets where local artists and artisans sell handcrafted works, or come daily during peak season when stalls featuring artisanal products operate.",

  "vibe": "Batumi Piazza exudes a transported-to-Italy atmosphere that feels simultaneously authentic and delightfully surreal in its Georgian context. The square pulses with a distinctly European cafe culture vibe, where locals and tourists alike settle into outdoor terraces for leisurely coffee sessions and extended people-watching. By day, the mood is relaxed and contemplative, with sunlight filtering through Dolores Hoffmann's colorful stained-glass windows and casting rainbow patterns across the intricate marble mosaic at your feet. The architectural intimacy of the enclosed square creates a cozy, almost theatrical setting, as if you've stumbled onto a carefully designed stage set for Italian life. As afternoon transitions to evening, the energy shifts dramatically. Decorative lighting illuminates the ornate facades, the clock tower glows against the darkening sky, and the space transforms into Batumi's liveliest cultural hub. Live music spills from multiple venues, creating an eclectic soundtrack that ranges from traditional Georgian folk melodies to contemporary rock performances. The atmosphere becomes festive and convivial, with the clink of wine glasses, animated conversations in multiple languages, and the aromatic blend of Georgian and European cuisines wafting from surrounding restaurants. Despite being artificial and newly constructed (2009-2010), the square has successfully cultivated an aged, timeless quality that makes it feel like a historic gathering place. There's a palpable sense of local pride mixed with tourist curiosity, as Batumians treat this as a beloved community space rather than merely a attraction.",
  "expectations": [
    "The square will be an easy-to-find landmark prominently featured on the waterfront or main streets of Batumi.",

    "The mosaic and stained glass will be prominently displayed and easily viewed from standing level on the square.",
    "Prices at the restaurants and cafes will be similar to other establishments throughout Batumi.",
    "The square will be a peaceful, quiet retreat for relaxation away from Batumi's bustling tourist areas."

  "reality": [
    "The square is cleverly hidden behind surrounding buildings in Old Batumi, occupying an entire city block where a school once stood, and you can easily walk right past it without realizing you're close.",
    "While named after Piazza San Marco, architect Vazha Orbeladze actually drew inspiration from Florence's Piazza della Signoria, creating a more enclosed, intimate square without water views but with a distinctive clock tower and compact Italian town atmosphere.",
    "The 106-square-meter marble mosaic is best appreciated from a 'secret balcony' on upper floors of surrounding buildings rather than ground level, where the intricate details of 88 million pieces are difficult to fully comprehend.",
    "Restaurants and cafes charge noticeably higher prices than elsewhere in Batumi, with beer costing more than the typical 3 GEL found around the city, and some visitors report diluted drinks and disappointing food quality.",
    "The square is actually Batumi's liveliest entertainment hub with near-constant live music, weekend rock concerts, and absurdly loud lounge music from hotel courtyards until midnight, plus frequent clock tower gongs that prevent sleep for light sleepers in nearby hotels."
