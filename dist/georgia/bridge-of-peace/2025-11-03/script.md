## HOOK (0:00-0:10)

**VISUAL**: Close-up of Lilia's face at night, the Bridge of Peace glowing white with LED lights behind her, slightly annoyed expression

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"Okay so locals here nicknamed this bridge 'Always Ultra.' Yeah. Like the tampon. And honestly? I get it."

**VISUAL**: Quick cut to wide shot of the bridge—its curved, white, glowing form against Old Town Tbilisi's historic architecture. The contrast is jarring.

---

## ACT 1: SETUP & FIRST IMPRESSIONS (0:10-2:30)

**VISUAL**: Walking footage from Old Town towards the bridge, daytime. 19th-century buildings, brick, ornamental details.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"Here's the thing about Tbilisi. I've been living here for months now, right? And this city, it's all weathered brick, wood balconies, these insane ornamental buildings from like the 1800s. Everything feels... lived-in. Real. Historic, you know?"

**VISUAL**: First glimpse of the Bridge of Peace from street level—this ultra-modern glass-and-steel structure suddenly appearing among old buildings.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"And then there's this. The Bridge of Peace. It's like someone dropped a spaceship right in the middle of a museum. Like, literally. And I'm not exaggerating."

**VISUAL**: Cut to Lilia standing at the entrance to the bridge, daytime, looking slightly skeptical.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"I wasn't gonna make a video about this bridge. I wasn't. Because honestly, I didn't know what I thought about it. Everyone told me, 'Oh you have to see it at night, the lights are amazing, it's so beautiful.' But no one told me that half of Tbilisi actually hates this thing."

**VISUAL**: B-roll of the bridge during daytime—looks clinical, almost sterile. White steel hoops, glass panels. Locals crossing it for their daily commute, completely ignoring the structure.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"So I came during the day first. Just to see. And you know what? It's... fine. Like, it's fine. It's a bridge. It's clean. It's modern. It looks like it belongs in, I don't know, Dubai or Singapore or some planned city. Not here. Not in the middle of all this history."

---

## ACT 2: RESEARCH & CONTROVERSY (2:30-5:00)

**VISUAL**: Lilia sitting at a café near the bridge, laptop open, scrolling through articles.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"So I started digging. Because I wanted to understand why this bridge makes people so angry. And let me tell you, it's wild. It's just wild."

**VISUAL**: Quick cuts of research details—architectural plans, construction photos, news articles.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"This thing opened in 2010. May 6th, 2010. Italian architect—Michele De Lucchi—designed it. The whole structure, 500 tons of steel, was built in Italy. Italy. They shipped it here in 200 trucks. Two hundred trucks. And then assembled it in 269 days. No accidents, no disputes, no cost overruns. Pretty impressive, right?"

**VISUAL**: Back to Lilia at café.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"But here's what I didn't expect. Architects here—Georgian architects, urban planners, heritage preservation people—they were pissed. Like, really pissed. They said it clashes with the historic district, that it's an eyesore, that it disrespects Tbilisi's architectural heritage."

**VISUAL**: Walking along the riverbank, showing the bridge from the side—the contrast between old and new is stark.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"And honestly? I see their point. This bridge, it's part of this whole modernization wave that happened after the Rose Revolution. The government wanted to show that Georgia was forward-thinking, contemporary, international. But in doing that, they kind of... ignored what was already here. The soul of the place, you know?"

**VISUAL**: Close-up of old Tbilisi buildings with wooden balconies, then pan to the ultra-modern bridge.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA, WALKING)**:
"The 'Always Ultra' nickname? That's locals being sarcastic. It's their way of saying, 'This is ridiculous.' And I mean, look at it—that curved white shape, the LED lights... it does kinda look like a feminine hygiene product. It does."

**VISUAL**: Lilia laughs, shaking her head.

**LILIA**:
"But you know what? I wanted to give it a fair shot. So I decided to come back at night. When the lights turn on. When it's supposed to be magical."

## ACT 3: NIGHTTIME TRANSFORMATION (5:00-7:30)

**VISUAL**: Sunset time-lapse over Tbilisi, the city transitioning from day to dusk. Blue hour approaching.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"The lighting system activates 90 minutes before sunset. Over 10,000 LED lights. 1,208 custom fixtures. All programmed to cycle through four different patterns every hour."

**VISUAL**: The bridge starts to glow. White light spreads across the curved canopy. It's... actually stunning.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"And okay. Okay. I'm not gonna lie. It's pretty fucking cool."

**VISUAL**: Lilia walking onto the bridge at night, wide shot showing her small figure under the glowing structure.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA, WALKING)**:
"So here's what happens. As you walk across, there are these motion sensors in the handrails—240 of them. And they trigger LED lights as you pass. So it's like the bridge is lighting up just for you. It's interactive. It responds to you."

**VISUAL**: Close-up of Lilia's hand on the glass handrail, LED lights activating as she moves. Her face shows genuine surprise and delight.

**LILIA**:
"Oh shit, look at that! See? It's following me. That's actually really cool. I wasn't expecting that."

**VISUAL**: Other people on the bridge—couples holding hands, kids running ahead to trigger the lights, tourists taking photos, locals commuting through the chaos.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"The bridge gets crowded at night. Tourists with cameras, couples on dates, families with kids. But also, like, regular people. Locals using this as their daily route home. Just walking through, completely unbothered by all the photo-taking happening around them."

**VISUAL**: Lilia reaches the center of the bridge—the widened "square" section where people gather. She stops, leans on the railing, looks out at the city.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"There's this Morse code message that pulses across the bridge every hour. The periodic table of elements. Like, the scientific periodic table. It's supposed to symbolize life, knowledge, progress. But most people—like 99% of people—have no idea it's happening. They just see pretty lights."

**VISUAL**: Trying to capture the Morse code lights, but it's subtle and easy to miss.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"I tried to spot it. I stood here for like fifteen minutes. And honestly? I couldn't tell. Maybe I'm just not smart enough to decode Morse code while standing on a crowded bridge at night. But it's a cool idea. Like, a hidden message celebrating science and human knowledge. That's actually beautiful, even if no one sees it."

**VISUAL**: Panoramic shot of Tbilisi at night from the bridge—the river, the lights of the city, Narikala Fortress illuminated on the hill.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"And from here, the view is... it's honestly gorgeous. You can see Old Town on one side, Rike Park on the other, Narikala Fortress up on the hill. The lights reflecting on the water. It's one of those moments where you just... stop. You stop moving and you just take it in."

## ACT 4: THE COMPLEXITY (7:30-9:00)

**VISUAL**: Lilia walking back across the bridge, slower now, more reflective.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"So here's where I'm at with this bridge. I don't think it's perfect. I don't think it belongs here, architecturally. The locals are right—it clashes. It's a modern intrusion into a historic space."

**VISUAL**: Split-screen or quick cuts showing the contrast again—old Tbilisi vs the bridge.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"But you know what? I also think it's kind of brave. Like, the city took a risk. They said, 'We're not just a museum. We're not frozen in the past. We're alive, we're evolving, we're making bold choices.' And yeah, sometimes bold choices look like a giant tampon glowing over the river. But at least they're trying, you know?"

**VISUAL**: Back to Lilia on the bridge, nighttime, LED lights glowing around her.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"I think what bothers me most is that there's no context here. No signs, no plaques, no explanation. Most tourists have no idea this bridge is controversial. They don't know about the debates, the architectural criticism, the local nickname. They just see a cool modern bridge and they take their Instagram photos and they leave."

**VISUAL**: Tourists posing for selfies, completely oblivious to the complexity.

**LILIA**:
"And that's a missed opportunity. Because this bridge? It's actually a really interesting conversation about preservation versus progress, about whose vision gets to shape a city, about tourism versus local identity. But no one's having that conversation. We're just... taking selfies."

**VISUAL**: Lilia takes a deliberately ironic selfie, rolls her eyes at herself.

**LILIA**:
"Including me, apparently."

## ACT 5: PRACTICAL REALITY (9:00-9:45)

**VISUAL**: Daytime footage again, Lilia walking across with a more neutral perspective.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"A few practical things. The bridge is free. Open 24/7. You can cross whenever you want. During the day, it's just functional—a way to get from Old Town to Rike Park without a long detour."

**VISUAL**: Close-ups of the glass walkway surface.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"The glass surface gets really slippery when it rains. Like, genuinely dangerous. Wear good shoes. I almost ate shit here once when it was wet."

**VISUAL**: Nighttime scene, crowded central platform.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"At night during peak tourist season, watch your stuff. Pickpockets work this bridge. They know people are distracted with cameras and phones. I've heard multiple stories."

**VISUAL**: View from Narikala Fortress—elevated shot showing the full bridge lit up against the cityscape.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"The best photos of this bridge? They're not from the bridge itself. They're from up there. Narikala Fortress, or Metekhi Church. You need that elevated perspective to really see the full bow shape. From the bridge, you're just... on it. You can't appreciate the design."

## OUTRO: REFLECTION (9:45-10:00)

**VISUAL**: Lilia standing on the riverbank near the bridge, nighttime, the structure glowing in the background. Final thoughts.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"So do I love the Bridge of Peace? Honestly? I don't know. I don't know. Some days I think it's beautiful. Other days I think it's an architectural mistake. But I appreciate that it makes me think. It makes me question. It's not just another pretty thing to photograph and forget."

**VISUAL**: Wide shot of the bridge, lights pulsing gently, people crossing.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"Tbilisi is full of contradictions like this. Old and new smashed together. Tradition and experiment. Beauty and chaos. And maybe that's the point. Maybe cities aren't supposed to be perfect. Maybe they're supposed to be complicated."

**VISUAL**: Lilia walking away from the bridge into Old Town streets, glancing back once.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"I'll keep crossing this bridge. I'll keep using it. Because it's here. It's part of Tbilisi now, whether locals like it or not. And maybe someday they'll stop calling it Always Ultra. Or maybe they won't. Either way, it's theirs to name."

**VISUAL**: Final shot—the bridge at night from across the river, lights glowing, city alive around it.

## PRODUCTION NOTES

### Key Shots Needed:
- Daytime bridge from Old Town approach (establishing contrast)
- Nighttime LED activation sequence (time-lapse)
- Motion-sensor handrail close-up (interactive element)
- Central platform with crowd (social dynamic)
- View from Narikala Fortress (elevated perspective)
- Slippery walkway surface (practical warning)
- Split-screen: old Tbilisi vs modern bridge (visual tension)

### Music Cues:
- **0:00-2:30**: Subtle, slightly tense ambient (reflecting uncertainty)
- **2:30-5:00**: More analytical, documentary-style (research section)
