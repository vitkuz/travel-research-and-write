---

## HOOK (0:00-0:10)

**VISUAL**: Dramatic low-angle shot of massive stone pillars towering against the sky, 30+ meters tall. Wind sound, isolated feeling.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER, intense)**:
"They call this Georgian Stonehenge. Everyone told me I had to see it. No one told me it's from 1985."

**VISUAL**: Quick cut to Lilia standing at the base of the pillars, craning her neck up, looking genuinely overwhelmed by the scale.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"This place is fucking huge. And empty. And like... I'm the only person here."

---

## ACT 1: THE JOURNEY OUT (0:10-2:30)

**VISUAL**: Inside a taxi driving through Tbilisi suburbs. Lilia in the backseat, filming out the window.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"Okay so here's the thing. I've been living in Tbilisi for months, right? And I kept seeing photos of these massive pillars online. Chronicles of Georgia. Georgian Stonehenge. People calling it a hidden gem, a must-see."

**VISUAL**: Driving past Soviet-era apartment blocks, getting farther from city center.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"But no one mentions that it's way outside the city. Like, way outside. You can't walk there. You can't metro there. You need a taxi or a car. And you're driving through these Soviet suburbs, these massive housing blocks, heading toward Tbilisi Sea—which is actually a reservoir, not a sea, by the way."

**VISUAL**: The taxi climbs uphill. Tbilisi Sea comes into view—a large blue reservoir surrounded by hills.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA, in taxi)**:
"And I'm sitting here in this taxi thinking, 'Is this gonna be worth it?' Because I've made trips like this before where you go all the way out somewhere and then it's just... disappointing, you know? And you can't even leave easily because you're in the middle of nowhere."

**VISUAL**: Taxi pulls up to the monument site. Empty parking area. No other cars. No tourist infrastructure visible.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"We arrive. And there's no one here. Like, no one. No ticket booth, no gift shop, no other tourists. Just me and these pillars."

**VISUAL**: Lilia getting out of taxi, paying driver. Uncertain expression as she watches the taxi drive away.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"And now I'm alone on a hilltop outside Tbilisi. This is either gonna be incredible or a huge mistake."

---

## ACT 2: FIRST ENCOUNTER (2:30-5:00)

**VISUAL**: Wide shot of Lilia walking toward the pillars. They're massive—16 towering columns reaching 100+ feet into the sky.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"And then I see them up close. And okay. Okay. I get it now."

**VISUAL**: Slow pan up one pillar from ground to sky. The scale is overwhelming. Intricate bas-relief carvings cover the surface.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA, standing at base)**:
"These are... these are like ten stories tall. Each one. Sixteen of them. Just standing here on this hilltop like ancient sentinels. The scale is insane. Photos don't capture it. You have to be here to feel how small you are."

**VISUAL**: Close-ups of the bas-relief carvings—biblical scenes, Georgian kings, intricate details.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"The carvings are incredible. The lower sections show Jesus's life—Palm Sunday, the Last Supper, the Resurrection. All these biblical scenes carved into the stone. And the upper parts? Georgian kings, queens, heroes. Three thousand years of Georgian history carved into these pillars."

**VISUAL**: Lilia touching the carvings, running her hand over the stone surface.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"So here's what I didn't expect. This isn't ancient. This isn't Stonehenge. This was built in 1985. Nineteen eighty-five. Like, I was born in—okay never mind—but the point is, this is Soviet-era."

**VISUAL**: Walking around the pillars, showing their arrangement in a circular formation.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"A sculptor named Zurab Tsereteli started building this in 1985 to commemorate 3,000 years of Georgian statehood and 2,000 years of Christianity. Ambitious, right? Massive state project. Soviet ambition at its peak."

**VISUAL**: Lilia stops walking, looks up at the pillars again.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"But here's the thing that gets me. It's not finished. It's been almost 40 years. Forty years. And it's still not done. Construction just... stopped. Maybe when the Soviet Union collapsed. Maybe on purpose. No one really knows."

---

## ACT 3: EXPLORING THE SILENCE (5:00-7:00)

**VISUAL**: Wide shot showing the isolation—Lilia is a tiny figure among these massive structures. Wind sound prominent.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"And I'm alone here. Completely alone. The wind is howling through the pillars. You can hear it whistling between the stones. And it's so quiet otherwise. No city noise, no traffic, no people."

**VISUAL**: Lilia discovers the small chapel behind the pillars. Surprise on her face.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"There's a chapel back here. I didn't know about this. It's tiny compared to the pillars—like a little spiritual hideaway tucked behind these monuments."

**VISUAL**: Inside or around the chapel—intimate, quiet space contrasting with the massive pillars.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"And from here, behind the chapel, the views open up."

**VISUAL**: Panoramic sweep—Tbilisi Sea below, Soviet apartment blocks creating geometric patterns on the hillsides, distant mountains on the horizon.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA, genuinely moved)**:
"Holy shit. Look at this. The reservoir down there—Tbilisi Sea—and all these Soviet buildings, and the mountains way back there. This view... this view is incredible."

**VISUAL**: Lilia standing at the viewpoint, taking it in. Genuine moment of appreciation.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"And here's what's wild. The view—the actual view—is better than the monument. Like, the monument is impressive, don't get me wrong. But standing here looking out over this landscape, the reservoir, those mountains... this is what makes the journey worth it."

---

## ACT 4: WRESTLING WITH MEANING (7:00-9:00)

**VISUAL**: Lilia walking slowly between the pillars, contemplative.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"So I'm trying to figure out how I feel about this place. Because it's complicated, you know? It's beautiful. It's also kind of sad. It's impressive. It's also unfinished. It's isolated. It's also peaceful."

**VISUAL**: Close-up of weathered carvings—beautiful but showing age and lack of maintenance.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"There's no signs here. No plaques explaining what you're looking at. No visitor center. You either come here knowing the history, or you just see big pillars and shrug. And that feels like a missed opportunity. Because there's so much meaning here if you know where to look."

**VISUAL**: Soviet apartment blocks visible in the background, contrasting with the monument.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"This is Soviet ambition, right? This is that era when they built massive things to show power, to show vision. Build something so big it can't be ignored. But then the Soviet Union collapsed, the money dried up, and projects like this just... stopped."

**VISUAL**: Back to the pillars, emphasizing their unfinished quality—some sections less detailed than others.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"And now it sits here. Partially finished. Partially forgotten. Locals have mixed feelings about it. Some think it's an important cultural monument. Others see it as an abandoned Soviet relic. Tourists call it Georgian Stonehenge and come take photos."

**VISUAL**: Lilia sitting on a low wall or stone, looking at the pillars.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"I don't know if it's finished or unfinished. Maybe Tsereteli—the sculptor—maybe he meant to leave it this way. Maybe the incompleteness is the point. Like, history is never finished. Georgia's story is still being written."

**VISUAL**: Close-up of Lilia, genuine emotion.

**LILIA**:
"Or maybe it's just an unfinished project and I'm romanticizing it. I do that. I romanticize shit."

**VISUAL**: Lilia laughs at herself, shaking her head.

## ACT 5: THE ISOLATION REALITY (9:00-10:00)

**VISUAL**: Time-lapse showing Lilia has been there a while. Still no other visitors. Sun position changed.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"I've been here for over an hour. Not a single other person has shown up. Not one."

**VISUAL**: Lilia checking her phone, presumably for taxi apps.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"And here's the practical reality. This place is remote. You need transportation. Budget at least an hour just for the journey from central Tbilisi—more if traffic's bad. And budget time to actually be here, walk around, take photos, sit with it."

**VISUAL**: Walking around showing different angles of the monument.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"Come on a clear day—on overcast days you lose those incredible mountain views. Bring a wide-angle lens because these pillars are massive and you can't back up far enough with a regular phone camera. Wear comfortable shoes because it's a hilltop, uneven ground, lots of walking."

**VISUAL**: Checking weather, showing wind blowing Lilia's hair.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"And it's windy up here. Like, really windy. It's exposed. Bring a jacket even if it's warm in the city."

**VISUAL**: Final panoramic shot of the entire monument complex from a distance.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"Is it worth the journey? Honestly? That depends on what you're looking for."

---

## ACT 6: REFLECTION (10:00-10:45)

**VISUAL**: Lilia standing among the pillars one last time, golden hour light starting.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"If you want easy Instagram content, go to the Bridge of Peace downtown. It's accessible, it's busy, it's lit up at night. But if you want something different—something that makes you think, that gives you space, that feels like a discovery—then yeah. Come here."

**VISUAL**: Close-up of intricate carving details catching the light.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"This place rewards curiosity. It rewards effort. You have to want to be here. And if you do make that effort, you get this—silence, massive art, incredible views, and time to think."

**VISUAL**: Wide shot of Lilia walking away from the pillars toward where she'll catch her ride back.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA, walking)**:
"Georgian Stonehenge. It's not ancient. It's not finished. It's not even easy to get to. But it's honest. It's real. It's a monument to ambition—both fulfilled and unfulfilled."

**VISUAL**: Lilia stops, turns back to look at the pillars one more time.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"And I respect that more than perfection."

---

## OUTRO: DEPARTURE (10:45-11:00)

**VISUAL**: Taxi arriving. Lilia getting in. One last view of the pillars through the car window as they drive away.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"I came here skeptical. I left... not disappointed. That's something. In a city full of crowded attractions and tourist traps, this place gave me space to breathe. Space to think."

**VISUAL**: Driving back through the suburbs, pillars disappearing into the distance.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"Sometimes the hidden gems are hidden for good reasons—they're remote, they're difficult, they're not for everyone. But if you're the kind of traveler who likes discovering places on your own terms, places with stories and complexity and no easy answers..."

**VISUAL**: Final shot of the pillars standing against the sky from far away, silhouetted against clouds.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"...then you'll get this place. You'll get why I made the journey."

- **Departure**: Leaving the site, pillars receding into distance

### B-Roll Priority:
1. **Scale shots** (essential): Ground-to-sky pillar pans showing overwhelming height
2. **Isolation shots**: Empty site, no other visitors, just Lilia and structures
3. **Carving details**: Biblical scenes (Last Supper, Resurrection) and Georgian kings
4. **Views from chapel**: Panoramic reservoir and mountain vistas
5. **Weather elements**: Wind effects, clouds moving past pillars

- **10:00-end**: Resolution without conclusion (acceptance of ambiguity)

**Note**: Use wind sound as recurring audio motif—the isolation and exposure of the hilltop site

### Pacing Notes:
- **Slow down during scale reveals**: Let viewers absorb the overwhelming size
- **Linger on the views**: The panoramas deserve screen time—they're a major payoff
- **Don't rush the reflection section**: The complexity is the point, not a plot twist

## VISUAL STORYTELLING TECHNIQUES

### Contrast as Theme:
- **Ancient appearance vs 1985 reality**: Show how it looks prehistoric but is contemporary
- **Massive scale vs human size**: Constantly establish Lilia's tiny form against pillars
- **Ambitious vision vs incomplete reality**: Beautiful carvings next to unfinished sections
- **Soviet architecture vs religious monument**: Communist housing blocks in view of Christian art
- **Isolation vs accessibility**: Empty site contrasting with crowded downtown attractions
- **Expectations vs reality**: "Stonehenge" nickname vs actual Soviet monument

### Camera Techniques:
- **Low angles**: Emphasize overwhelming height of pillars
- **Wide shots**: Show isolation and emptiness of site
- **Close-ups**: Reveal intricate carving details that reward examination
- **Pans**: Slow vertical pans from ground to sky showing full scale
- **Drone shots**: If available, establish the hilltop location and Tbilisi Sea views
- **Tracking shots**: Follow Lilia walking between pillars showing their arrangement
- **Time-lapse**: Show passage of time with no other visitors arriving

### Audio Layers:
- **Wind**: Constant presence emphasizing exposure and isolation
- **Footsteps**: On uneven terrain, creating sense of exploration
- **Silence**: Use empty audio space when reflecting on the site
- **Distant city**: Very faint traffic/urban noise in background (but barely)
- **Music**: Keep minimal, let the location's natural atmosphere lead

## PRACTICAL FILMING CONSIDERATIONS

### Weather Planning:
- **Clear skies essential**: Mountain views are key payoff, lost in overcast conditions
- **Wind**: Expect strong gusts, secure equipment, use windscreen on mic
- **Golden hour**: Late afternoon provides best light for the stone pillars
- **Seasons**: Spring/autumn ideal for comfortable temps and dramatic skies

### Transportation:
- **Taxi coordination**: Arrange return pickup time or keep taxi waiting (extra cost)
- **Alternative**: Hire driver for half-day including multiple Tbilisi Sea attractions
- **Public bus**: Possible but adds significant time, research routes in advance

### On-Site Logistics:
- **Duration**: Plan 90-120 minutes on-site minimum for thorough filming
- **No facilities**: No restrooms, water, or shelter—come prepared
- **Mobile signal**: Check coverage, may need offline maps/research
- **Safety**: Site is isolated, consider traveling with companion for security
- **Equipment**: Bring wide-angle lens, tripod for stable low-light shots, extra batteries

### Research Prep:
- **Zurab Tsereteli**: Background on sculptor and his controversial works worldwide
- **Biblical scenes**: Identify which carvings show which stories
- **Georgian history**: Kings and heroes depicted in upper sections
- **Soviet context**: 1985 timing, state art projects, collapse aftermath
- **Local opinions**: Mixed Georgian reception adds nuance to story

## ALTERNATIVE ENDINGS (Choose Based on Editing Mood)

### Option A: Optimistic Resolution
*"I came here skeptical. I left grateful. Not every journey needs a destination. Sometimes the point is just to stand somewhere quiet and feel small for a while."*

### Option B: Practical Realism (USED IN SCRIPT)
*"I came here skeptical. I left... not disappointed. That's something. Sometimes the hidden gems are hidden for good reasons."*

### Option C: Poetic Ambiguity
*"Forty years unfinished. Maybe that's the most honest monument of all. Nothing's ever really complete, is it? Not history, not countries, not us."*

### Option D: Direct Address
*"If you make it here—really make it, past the taxi ride and the empty hilltop and the wind—let me know what you felt. I'm curious if it hit you the same way."*
