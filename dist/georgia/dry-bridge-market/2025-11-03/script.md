## HOOK (0:00-0:12)

**VISUAL**: Close-up of Lilia's hands holding a Soviet World War II medal. The camera pulls back to reveal hundreds of similar items spread on a blanket—medals, rubles, propaganda posters.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA, intense)**:
"This medal belonged to someone's grandfather. Probably fought in World War II. And now it's here, on this blanket, for sale. Five lari. That's like two dollars."

**VISUAL**: Wide shot of the chaotic market—tables everywhere, elderly vendors, piles of Soviet memorabilia.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"Welcome to Dry Bridge Market. Where Georgia's entire Soviet past is for sale."

---

## ACT 1: ARRIVAL & FIRST IMPRESSIONS (0:12-2:30)

**VISUAL**: Walking toward the market from Freedom Square. The historic Dry Bridge structure visible.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"Okay so, Dry Bridge Market. It's called that because there's literally a bridge here—built in 1851—that used to span the Kura River. But they drained the river in 1933. So now it's a bridge over... nothing. Just empty space. A dry bridge."

**VISUAL**: Entering the market area. Immediate sensory overload—vendors, tables, blankets on the ground, stuff everywhere.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA, stopping)**:
"And this? This is chaos. Like, beautiful, overwhelming chaos."

**VISUAL**: Panning across the market—no clear organization, vendors sitting on folding chairs, elderly men smoking, piles of random objects.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"There's no organization here. No signs saying 'Soviet section' or 'antiques this way.' Vendors just set up wherever. Spread their stuff on tables, on blankets, on the ground. And you just... wander. You dig. You hunt."

**VISUAL**: Close-ups of random items—old cameras next to taxidermy animals, vinyl records beside kitchenware, military swords leaning against chairs.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"And the stuff here? It's insane. Military medals next to stuffed foxes. Vintage radios beside propaganda posters. Coins, cameras, jewelry, swords. Things I can't even identify."

**VISUAL**: An elderly Georgian man sitting behind his display, smoking, watching people pass. Weathered face, tired eyes.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER, softer)**:
"But here's the thing that hits you. The vendors. Most of them are old. Really old. Georgian pensioners. And they're not selling antiques they found—they're selling their lives. Family heirlooms. Personal possessions. Memories."

---

## ACT 2: THE HISTORY LESSON (2:30-4:30)

**VISUAL**: Lilia sitting on a low wall at the edge of the market, catching her breath from the sensory overload.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"Let me tell you how this market started. Because it's not some cute tourist thing. It's darker than that."

**VISUAL**: B-roll of the market continuing in the background—people browsing, vendors rearranging items.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"This market has been here in some form since the 1950s. But it exploded in the early 1990s. Right after the Soviet Union collapsed. Georgia's economy tanked. People had no money, no jobs, no safety net. Pensions were worthless."

**VISUAL**: Close-up of elderly vendor counting small denomination bills. Careful, deliberate movements.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"So people came here. To this bridge. And they sold whatever they had. Medals their fathers earned. Radios they'd owned for decades. Dishes, jewelry, photographs. Personal things. Desperate things."

**VISUAL**: Back to Lilia, genuine emotion on her face.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"And that's still happening. Right now. Today. These aren't professional antique dealers—I mean, some are—but most are just old people trying to survive on Soviet pensions that barely cover rent. So they sell pieces of their past. Piece by piece."

**VISUAL**: Walking through the market again, more observant now, seeing the vendors differently.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"They call this 'the market of memories.' And that's exactly what it is. You're buying someone's memories. Their family history. And they need the money more than the memories."

---

## ACT 3: THE TREASURE HUNT (4:30-7:30)

**VISUAL**: Lilia actively browsing now, picking up items, examining them.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA, walking)**:
"Okay so let me show you what's actually here. Because it's wild."

### SECTION 1: Soviet Memorabilia (4:30-5:15)

**VISUAL**: Table covered in World War II medals, Soviet flags, old rubles.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"The Soviet stuff is everywhere. World War II medals—like, actual medals that actual soldiers wore. Propaganda posters. Old rubles that are worthless now but kind of beautiful. Communist flags. Military badges."

**VISUAL**: Lilia picking up a vintage radio, turning it over in her hands.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"This radio? Soviet-era. Still works, apparently. I don't know if I believe that, but okay."

**VISUAL**: Propaganda poster showing Soviet workers in heroic poses.

**LILIA**:
"And these posters. Some are originals from like the 1960s, 70s, 80s. Some are reprints. And honestly? I can't tell the difference. And that's a problem we'll talk about in a second."

### SECTION 2: Weird & Random (5:15-6:00)

**VISUAL**: Taxidermy animals on a table. Fox, birds, possibly other creatures in various states of preservation.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA, slightly horrified/amused)**:
"There's taxidermy. Like, why? Who is buying stuffed foxes at a flea market in Tbilisi? Apparently someone, because this guy keeps bringing them."

**VISUAL**: Ornate swords displayed on blankets.

**LILIA**:
"Military swords. I mean, these are beautiful. I have no idea if they're real or reproductions, but they look cool."

**VISUAL**: Vinyl records, old maps, Russian-language books in piles.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"There's a whole section with books, maps, vinyl records—mostly Russian language stuff, Georgian music, Soviet-era publications. If you're a collector, you'd go crazy here."

### SECTION 3: The Art & Modern Section (6:00-6:45)

**VISUAL**: Contemporary Georgian paintings displayed on easels, handmade jewelry.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"And then there's this whole other section with contemporary art. Georgian artists selling their work. Handmade jewelry. It's actually really beautiful. Less depressing than the Soviet stuff, honestly."

**VISUAL**: Talking to a younger vendor, an artist. Brief interaction showing the contrast between younger sellers and elderly ones.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"These younger vendors, the artists—they're here by choice. They want to be here. It's their profession. That energy is different. Lighter."

### SECTION 4: The Personal Moment (6:45-7:30)

**VISUAL**: Lilia stops at a table with an elderly woman vendor. Old photographs, small personal items, worn jewelry.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"And then you find tables like this."

**VISUAL**: The elderly woman's face—kind eyes, tired, weathered. She's not aggressively selling, just sitting with her items.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA, quieter)**:
"This woman. She's selling old photographs. Jewelry that looks like it came from her own jewelry box. Small things. Personal things."

**VISUAL**: Lilia picking up a piece of jewelry, examining it gently.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"And I don't know her story. I don't speak enough Georgian to ask. But I can guess. And it breaks my heart a little bit."

**VISUAL**: Lilia puts the item down carefully, gives a small smile to the woman, moves on.

---

## ACT 4: THE NEGOTIATION REALITY (7:30-9:00)

**VISUAL**: Lilia approaching a vendor with Soviet medals. Price negotiation about to happen.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA, low voice like she's sharing a secret)**:
"Okay so, haggling. You have to haggle here. Like, you have to. The initial price is always inflated—like double or triple what they'll actually take."

**VISUAL**: The negotiation plays out—vendor states a price, Lilia shakes her head, counters, vendor counters back, gestures, eventual agreement.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"The problem is, I hate haggling. I'm terrible at it. I feel guilty. These are old people, they need the money, and I'm trying to pay them less? It feels wrong."

**VISUAL**: Transaction completes. Lilia hands over Georgian Lari bills (small denominations), receives the item.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA, walking away from the stall)**:
"But if you don't haggle, they actually get offended. Or they think you're an idiot. And honestly, the asking prices are ridiculous. Twenty lari for something that's worth five. So you have to negotiate. It's part of the culture."

**VISUAL**: Another vendor, this one with less personal stuff—clearly a professional dealer with curated items.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"Some vendors are different though. The professional dealers. They're not selling family heirlooms. They're running businesses. Those people? Haggle hard. Don't feel guilty."

**VISUAL**: Close-up of cash transaction—no card machines, just bills changing hands.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"Cash only, by the way. No cards. Bring small bills. Like, tens and fives. Because if you hand them a fifty, they can't make change and the whole thing becomes awkward."

---

## ACT 5: THE AUTHENTICITY PROBLEM (9:00-10:00)

**VISUAL**: Lilia examining Soviet propaganda posters at different stalls, comparing.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"So here's the uncomfortable truth. A lot of this stuff? It's fake. Or reproductions. Or 'vintage-style' modern manufacturing."

**VISUAL**: Two similar medals side by side—trying to determine which is real.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"These medals? Some are real World War II medals. Some are modern replicas you can buy on Aliexpress. And unless you're an expert, you can't tell."

**VISUAL**: Propaganda poster that looks suspiciously clean and new.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"This poster? It looks too good. Too clean. It's probably a reprint. But the vendor swears it's original from 1975. Maybe it is. Maybe it's not. I don't know."

**VISUAL**: Lilia puts down the poster, moves on.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"And that's the gamble here. You're trusting vendors who have economic incentive to lie. You're buying things with no authentication, no certification, no way to verify. You either trust your instincts or you accept that you might be buying beautiful reproductions. And honestly? For most tourists, that's probably fine. It's the story and the aesthetic, not the actual provenance."

---

## ACT 6: THE LANGUAGE BARRIER (10:00-10:45)

**VISUAL**: Lilia trying to communicate with a vendor who speaks only Georgian/Russian. Gestures, numbers on phone screen, frustrated expressions turning to laughter.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"Most vendors don't speak English. Like, at all. So negotiation happens through like... universal language of numbers and gestures."

**VISUAL**: Showing phone with number typed in, vendor nodding or shaking head, counteroffering by typing their own number.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"You type numbers on your phone. They shake their head yes or no. You point at things. You make exaggerated shocked faces when prices are too high. It's like charades mixed with mathematics."

**VISUAL**: Successful transaction despite language barrier. Both parties smiling.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"And somehow it works. You figure it out. Humans are good at communicating when we have to be."

---

## ACT 7: THE EMOTIONAL WEIGHT (10:45-11:30)

**VISUAL**: Lilia sitting on a bench in the adjacent park, market visible in the background. Holding something she bought—maybe a medal or small piece of jewelry.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA, reflective)**:
"So I've been here for like two hours. And I'm tired. Not physically tired—emotionally tired."

**VISUAL**: Close-up of the item in her hands, turning it over.

**LILIA**:
"Because this place is heavy. It's fascinating and sad and beautiful and depressing all at once. Every object has a story. Every vendor has a history. And you're walking through this outdoor museum of Soviet collapse and Georgian survival."

**VISUAL**: Back to the market—wide shot showing the full scene, vendors waiting, tourists browsing, locals negotiating.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"And you start wondering—like, what's the ethical thing here? Am I helping by buying things, giving people money they need? Or am I exploiting desperation, benefiting from economic inequality?"

**VISUAL**: Back to Lilia on the bench.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"I don't have an answer. I think it's both. It's complicated. Everything here is complicated."

---

## ACT 8: PRACTICAL REALITY (11:30-12:00)

**VISUAL**: Walking through the market one more time, more purposeful now.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"Okay, practical stuff. The market is open 10am to 5pm daily. Come on weekends if you want maximum vendors and inventory. Avoid Mondays—only half the sellers show up."

**VISUAL**: Checking weather on phone, looking at sky.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"Check weather before coming. It's an open-air market. Heavy rain means it might not operate at all. No advance warning system. It just doesn't happen."

**VISUAL**: People digging through piles of items, examining things carefully.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"Budget at least an hour, probably two. The good stuff is hidden. You have to dig. You have to look carefully. Quick surface browsing misses everything."

**VISUAL**: Vendor who clearly doesn't want to be photographed, turning away from camera.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"And ask before taking photos. Some vendors hate cameras. Others don't care. Just ask. Be respectful."

---

## OUTRO: LEAVING THE MARKET (12:00-12:30)

**VISUAL**: Lilia walking away from the market toward Freedom Square, looking back once.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"So would I recommend Dry Bridge Market? Yeah. Yeah, I would. But know what you're getting into."

**VISUAL**: Final shots of the market as the camera pulls away—vendors still sitting with their memories spread out for sale.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"This isn't a fun tourist shopping experience. It's not cute. It's real. It's raw. It's Georgia's Soviet past laid out on blankets and tables. It's elderly people selling pieces of their lives because their pensions don't cover rent."

**VISUAL**: Close-up of Lilia's purchase in her bag—whatever small item she bought.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"And if you can sit with that complexity—if you can appreciate the history while acknowledging the economic desperation—then come. Wander. Dig through the chaos. Talk to the vendors if you can. Try to understand the stories."

**VISUAL**: Final wide shot of the Dry Bridge itself—the literal bridge over empty space.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA, final thought)**:
"A bridge over nothing. That's what this place is. A connection to a past that doesn't exist anymore. Soviet Georgia is gone. But the objects remain. The memories remain. Here. For sale."

**VISUAL**: Lilia turns and walks away. The market continues behind her—vendors waiting, browsers searching, memories changing hands.

## PRODUCTION NOTES

### Key Shots Needed:
- **The chaos**: Wide establishing shots showing the overwhelming disorder
- **Vendor portraits**: Elderly Georgian faces, especially contemplative moments
- **Object close-ups**: Medals, posters, personal items—tell stories through objects
- **Negotiations**: Capture the haggling process, gestures, facial expressions
- **The bridge itself**: The historic structure that gives the market its name
- **Emotional moments**: Lilia processing the weight of what she's witnessing
- **Language barrier interactions**: Phone numbers, gestures, universal communication
- **Cash transactions**: Bills changing hands, no digital payments
- **Hidden treasures**: Digging through piles, finding unexpected items
- **Contrast**: Young artists vs elderly pensioners, professional dealers vs desperate sellers

### B-Roll Priority:
1. **Elderly vendors with personal items** (heart of the story)
2. **Soviet memorabilia close-ups** (WWI medals, propaganda, rubles)
3. **Chaotic organization** (random juxtapositions: taxidermy + medals + vinyl)
4. **Negotiation gestures** (shaking heads, typing numbers, hand waves)
5. **Cash transactions** (small bills, change-making struggles)
6. **Objects being examined** (hands turning over medals, reading dates, checking authenticity)
7. **The dry bridge structure** (architectural context)
8. **Facial expressions** (vendors waiting, tourists surprised, locals negotiating)
9. **Weather elements** (sun through trees, potential for rain, market closing)
10. **Items with visible history** (worn jewelry, faded photos, aged radios)

### Audio Layers:
- **Ambient market sounds**: Vendor calls, multiple languages (Georgian, Russian, broken English)
- **Negotiation snippets**: Price discussions, even without understanding words
- **Cash sounds**: Bills shuffling, coins clinking
- **Footsteps**: On pavement, through cramped vendor rows
- **Wind**: Through the bridge structure, rustling papers/posters
- **Silence**: Strategic quiet moments during emotional reflection

### Music Cues:
- **0:00-2:30**: Slightly haunting, mysterious (discovery and first impressions)
- **2:30-4:30**: More somber, historical (learning the market's origins)
- **4:30-7:30**: Neutral exploration tone (treasure hunt energy without being too upbeat)
- **7:30-10:00**: Slightly tense (negotiation complexities, authenticity concerns)
- **10:45-11:30**: Emotional, reflective (processing the experience)
- **12:00-end**: Contemplative resolution (accepting complexity)

**Note**: Music should never be too cheerful—this isn't a fun shopping trip

### Pacing Notes:
- **Quick hook**: Get to emotional core immediately (medal = someone's grandfather)
- **Slow down for history**: The 1990s collapse context deserves time
- **Dynamic browsing section**: Quick cuts between different market areas
- **Linger on emotional moments**: Elderly woman's table, Lilia's reflection
- **Practical section can be faster**: Information delivery mode
- **Contemplative ending**: Don't rush the complexity

### Emotional Beats:
1. **Intrigue** (hook): What is this place?
2. **Overwhelm** (arrival): Sensory chaos
3. **Sadness** (history): Soviet collapse, economic desperation
4. **Curiosity** (treasure hunt): What treasures are hidden here?
5. **Discomfort** (negotiation): Haggling with people who need money
6. **Skepticism** (authenticity): Can I trust what I'm buying?
7. **Frustration** (language): Communication barriers
8. **Heaviness** (weight): Processing the ethical complexity
9. **Acceptance** (outro): Sitting with the contradictions

### Ethical Filming Considerations:
- **Ask permission**: Many vendors don't want to be filmed (respect this)
- **Obscure faces if needed**: Some people are selling out of desperation, protect privacy
- **Don't exploit**: Don't make poverty poverty-porn
- **Show dignity**: Vendors are people with agency, not victims for content
- **Fair representation**: Show professional dealers AND desperate pensioners (both exist)
- **Acknowledge complexity**: Don't romanticize or condemn—just show reality
