## HOOK (0:00 - 0:15)

**VISUAL:** Close-up of massive limestone blocks, each nearly a meter thick, weathered but solid. Camera pulls back to reveal towers stretching toward mountains.

**AUDIO - LILIA:**

"Okay so here's the thing. I'm standing next to stones that are two thousand years old. Two thousand. Like, Roman soldiers touched these exact same blocks I'm touching right now. And I can't stop thinking—what the hell were they doing way out here?"

---

## ACT 1: ARRIVAL & FIRST IMPRESSIONS (0:15 - 2:30)

**VISUAL:** Marshrutka ride from Batumi. Windows show Black Sea coastline, then turning inland. Fortress walls appear in distance. Soviet apartment blocks visible behind ancient towers.

**AUDIO - LILIA:**

"Getting here cost me exactly 1.50 GEL on marshrutka number 16 from Batumi. That's like... forty cents? To see one of the most important Roman sites in the entire Caucasus. I'm not gonna lie, I was skeptical. Super skeptical.

Because here's what nobody tells you about Gonio Fortress. It's twelve kilometers south of Batumi, right? And when you pull up, the first thing you see is Soviet apartment blocks. Like, babushkas hanging laundry literally behind two-thousand-year-old Roman towers. It's surreal. Just surreal.

I paid 10 GEL to get in—that's three bucks—and I'm walking through this massive gate thinking, 'Is this gonna be one of those ruins where it's just... foundations? You know, like stones on the ground and you have to imagine everything?'

Turns out... no. Turns out I was completely wrong."

**VISUAL:** Walking through the main gate. Camera captures the moment of entering—transition from modern street to ancient interior.

**AUDIO - LILIA:**

"The moment I stepped inside, I felt it. You know when a place just hits different? The walls here are 900 meters around. Eighteen towers still standing out of the original twenty-two. And you can climb them. Like, actually climb the stone staircases that Roman soldiers used. Touch the same walls they touched.

I wasn't expecting that kind of... access, you know? Most historical sites, they rope everything off. Not here. Here, you're in it."

## ACT 2: EXPLORATION & DISCOVERY (2:30 - 6:00)

**VISUAL:** Lilia climbing stone staircase inside corner tower. Hands touching walls. View from tower top showing Black Sea on one side, snow-capped Caucasus mountains on other.

**AUDIO - LILIA:**

"So I'm climbing this tower, right? And the stones under my feet—they're uneven, worn down from two thousand years of footsteps. Roman footsteps. Byzantine footsteps. Ottoman footsteps. All these empires, all these soldiers climbing the exact same stairs.

And when you get to the top... holy shit. Holy shit. On one side, you've got the Black Sea stretching forever. On the other side, snow-capped mountains rising straight up. And you're standing here thinking—yeah. Yeah, I get why they built a fortress here. This location is insane, just insane."

**VISUAL:** Walking along fortress perimeter. Camera shows three distinct layers in wall construction—massive Roman blocks at base, Byzantine stones in middle, Ottoman mortar at top.

**AUDIO - LILIA:**

"Here's what blew my mind though. You can literally see history in layers. Look at this wall. The bottom? Those are the original Roman blocks. Massive. Like, up to one meter thick. They've been here since the first century AD, since Emperor Vespasian.

Then in the middle, you've got Byzantine reinforcements. Different stone, different technique. And at the top? Ottoman-era mortar. It's like... it's like reading a timeline with your hands. Three empires, one wall. All visible. All right here.

I spent like twenty minutes just staring at this one section. Just staring. Because when do you ever get to touch something that old? When?"

**VISUAL:** Interior of fortress. Foundation stones where buildings once stood. Archaeological excavation sites with markers.

**AUDIO - LILIA:**

"The inside, though. The inside is mostly foundations now. You can see where the barracks were, where the bathhouse stood, where they had a theatre—an actual Roman theatre way out here on the edge of the empire. At its peak, fifteen hundred soldiers lived here. Fifteen hundred.

There was a hippodrome. A sophisticated water supply system with wells and underground channels. Sewage systems. Roads. This wasn't just a fortress, it was a city. A Roman city in the Caucasus.

But now? Now it's quiet. Wild grass growing between the stones. Just me and maybe five other people wandering around. No crowds. No tour groups shouting. Just... silence and ruins and mountains."

**VISUAL:** Walking toward marble gazebo. Fresh flowers and lit candles visible.

**AUDIO - LILIA:**

"And then there's this. This marble gazebo right in the middle of the fortress. You see those flowers? Those candles? They're fresh. Like, someone left them today.

This is supposedly the tomb of the Apostle Matthias. You know, one of Christ's twelve disciples? The one who replaced Judas? Legend says he's buried right here under this marble.

Here's the thing though—nobody knows for sure. The Georgian government won't allow excavations. Religious authorities won't allow it either. Because if they dig it up and it's not him? That could cause conflict. Serious conflict.

So it stays sealed. Forever. This mystery tomb that people have been leaving flowers at for who knows how long.

And honestly? I kind of love that. I love that it's unknown. That some things stay mysterious. Even the Ottomans during 331 years of occupation—331 years—they never touched it. Never looted it. Even though they built a soldiers' mosque right nearby.

That's... that's something. You know? That's respect across empires, across religions, across time."

**VISUAL:** Small on-site museum. Display cases with Roman amphorae, red gloss ceramics, ancient coins, jewelry.

**AUDIO - LILIA:**

"The little museum here? It's tiny. Like, one room. But they've got actual Roman pottery. Coins. Jewelry from the fifth century AD.

In 1974, they accidentally discovered treasure chests near the southern wall. Just accidentally. Full of gold coins and jewels that had been buried for fifteen hundred years. Perfectly preserved. Nobody knew they were there through all those wars, all those occupations.

I'm standing here looking at a Roman amphora thinking—someone packed wine in this. Or olive oil. Carried it from who knows where. Used it every day. And now it's in a glass case in Georgia and I'm staring at it like... wow."

## ACT 3: REFLECTION & EMOTIONAL PEAK (6:00 - 8:00)

**VISUAL:** Lilia sitting on ancient stone wall. Golden hour light. Mountains in background. Quiet moment.

**AUDIO - LILIA:**

"I wasn't expecting this place to hit me like this. I really wasn't.

Because you come to Georgia for wine and mountains and khachapuri, right? You don't come thinking about Romans. About empire. About how far people traveled two thousand years ago to stand in this exact spot and defend... what? Trade routes? Territory? The idea of Rome?

But sitting here on these walls, I started thinking about all the people who stood here before me. Roman legionnaires from Italy or Spain or North Africa. Byzantine soldiers. Ottoman guards. Russian troops. Georgian locals who lived through all of it.

And then archaeologists. And now tourists like me with our phones and our marshrutka tickets.

We're all just passing through. All of us. These stones are the only constant.

You know what the legend says? That when they built this fortress, people formed a human chain from Kvariati to Gonio. Passing these massive blocks hand to hand. I don't know if that's true. But I love the image. Hundreds of people connected, working together to build something that would outlast them by two thousand years.

That's the thing about places like this. They put your whole life in perspective. My nine years of traveling? My eight base countries? That's nothing. That's a blink. These walls have seen empires rise and fall. They've seen the Chorokhi River change course, seen languages change, seen religions change.

And they're still here. Still standing. With babushkas hanging laundry behind them and the Black Sea crashing in front of them and travelers like me sitting here trying to understand what any of it means."

**VISUAL:** Sunset. Light hitting the towers. Shadows lengthening. Lilia walking toward exit.

**AUDIO - LILIA:**

"I spent almost an hour here. Just wandering. Climbing. Touching walls. Sitting.

Most people do it in thirty minutes, the ticket guy told me. Thirty minutes. And yeah, I get it—if you're rushing, if you're just checking boxes, you can walk the perimeter and leave.

But why would you do that? Why would you rush past two thousand years?

The fortress closes at sunset. I stayed until they basically kicked me out. And even then, I didn't want to leave. Because places like this... they're rare. Places where you can physically touch ancient history. Where it's not reconstructed or prettified or turned into a theme park.

This is real. This is authentic. This is Romans on the Black Sea, as strange and impossible as that sounds."

## OUTRO: PRACTICAL INFO & FINAL THOUGHTS (8:00 - 8:30)

**VISUAL:** Walking toward Gonio Beach. Sea visible through fortress gates. Mountains behind.

**AUDIO - LILIA:**

"Here's what you need to know if you come here.

Take marshrutka 16, 33, or 88 from Batumi for 1.50 GEL. Entrance is 10 GEL. They've got an audio guide for another 10 GEL if you want the detailed history—I'd recommend it.

Bring water. Bring snacks. There's nothing inside to buy. Wear comfortable shoes because you'll be climbing stone stairs.

Come early morning or late afternoon for the best light and fewer people. And if you come in summer, check if they're doing concerts or theatre performances inside the fortress—apparently they transform this place at night.

Oh, and Gonio Beach is literally a five-minute walk away. So you can do ancient Roman history and Black Sea swimming in the same morning. Which is exactly what I did next.

Because here's the thing I've learned after all this traveling. The best experiences aren't the famous ones. They're not the crowded ones. They're places like this. Places that make you stop, make you think, make you feel small in the best possible way.

Gonio Fortress did that for me. Two thousand years of history for three dollars and a forty-cent marshrutka ride.

Sometimes Georgia just... it just gets it right, you know?

I'm Lilia. Thanks for coming with me on this one. It got emotional—I wanted to keep it short but nope, got emotional. That's what happens when Romans build fortresses on beaches with mountains behind them.

Anyway. See you in the next one."

**VISUAL:** Final shot of fortress from beach. Waves. Mountains. Towers silhouetted against sky.
