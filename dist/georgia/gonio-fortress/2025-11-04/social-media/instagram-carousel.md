### Slide 1: Title/Hook
**Visual:** Most dramatic shot of fortress towers against mountains/sea (preferably golden hour)
**Text Overlay:**
```
"Just Old Stones"

(That's what I thought)
```
**Design Notes:**
- Large, bold font for "Just Old Stones" (70-80pt, white text)
- Subtext in smaller italic font (40pt, slightly transparent)

### Slide 2: Setup/Expectation
**Visual:** View from marshrutka window or exterior shot showing Soviet apartments behind fortress

```
40 cents on a marshrutka
$3 to get in

I was skeptical
Super skeptical

Another tourist trap?
```
**Design Notes:**

### Slide 3: First Discovery
**Visual:** Massive fortress walls, close-up showing scale of Roman blocks

```
The stones are nearly
ONE METER THICK

2000 years old
And you can TOUCH them

Most sites rope everything off
Not here
```
**Design Notes:**
- Emphasize "ONE METER THICK" with bold or different color
- Center text or place in clear sky area

### Slide 4: Climbing Experience
**Visual:** Stone staircase inside tower, worn steps visible, or hand touching ancient wall
**Text Overlay:**
```
I'm climbing stairs
worn down by 2000 years
of footsteps

Roman soldiers
Byzantine warriors
Ottoman guards

All climbed these exact stairs
```

**Text Overlay:**
```
Black Sea stretching forever
Snow-capped mountains rising

And suddenly I understood

Why they built a fortress HERE
```
**Design Notes:**

**Character Count:** 100 characters

### Slide 6: History in Layers
**Visual:** Close-up of wall showing three distinct construction layers

```
You can SEE history in layers

⬇ Roman blocks (1st century)
⬇ Byzantine stones (medieval)
⬇ Ottoman mortar (17th century)

Three empires
One wall
```

Fresh flowers
Lit candles
Left today

Legend: Apostle Matthias buried here

But nobody knows for sure
The government won't dig it up

Some mysteries stay mysteries
```
**Design Notes:**

### Slide 8: Emotional Climax (SAVE FOR SLIDE 8—ALGORITHM HACK)
**Visual:** Lilia sitting on wall, contemplative, or close-up of hand on ancient stone

I sat on these walls
for an hour

Thinking about everyone
who stood here before me

Roman legionnaires
Byzantine soldiers
Travelers like me

We're all just passing through
These stones are the only constant
```
**Design Notes:**

That's nothing
That's a blink

These walls have seen
empires rise and fall

And they're still here
Still standing
```

- **Photo overlay:** Use gradient overlays (dark at bottom fading to transparent) for bottom-placed text
- **Consistency:** Same font pairing across all 10 slides
- **Visual variety:** Alternate text placement (top, bottom, left, right) to avoid monotony

**Special Design Considerations:**
- **Slide 1:** Biggest, boldest text—this is the thumbnail

## VISUAL STRATEGY

**Photo/Video Selection from Script Timeline:**

1. **Slide 1:** Fortress towers from exterior, dramatic angle (Act 1, arrival footage)
2. **Slide 2:** View from marshrutka or juxtaposition of Soviet buildings + fortress (Act 1)
3. **Slide 3:** Close-up of massive Roman blocks showing texture and scale (Act 2)
4. **Slide 4:** Interior stone staircase or hand touching wall (Act 2, climbing sequence)
5. **Slide 5:** Panoramic view from tower top—Black Sea + mountains (Act 2, top of tower)
6. **Slide 6:** Wall layers close-up showing three construction periods (Act 2, wall detail)
7. **Slide 7:** Marble tomb with fresh flowers and candles (Act 2, mystery tomb)
8. **Slide 8:** Lilia on wall, contemplative or close-up of hand/stone connection (Act 3, reflection)
9. **Slide 9:** Wide dramatic shot showing full fortress scale (Act 3, emotional peak)
10. **Slide 10:** Sunset silhouette or final atmospheric shot (Outro, closing)

**If Missing Specific Visuals:**
- **Pexels/Unsplash search terms:**
  - "Ancient stone fortress texture"
  - "Roman ruins sunset"
  - "Hand touching old stone wall"
  - "Black Sea Georgia coastline"
  - "Byzantine architecture detail"
  - "Historical site contemplation"

**Visual Tone Consistency:**
- Warm color grading (golden hour, earthy tones)
- Emphasis on texture and detail (weathered stone, worn steps)
- Mix of wide/epic and intimate/close-up shots
- Natural lighting preferred (no harsh flash)
- Atmospheric (mist, sunset, dramatic clouds enhance mood)

## POSTING TIPS

**Caption:** See `instagram-caption.md` for full caption to accompany this carousel

**Best Practices:**
- **Post timing:**
  - Primary: 7-9 AM EST (morning scroll, high engagement window)
  - Backup: 5-7 PM EST (evening commute/wind-down time)
- **First slide = EVERYTHING:** People decide to swipe in <1 second
  - Must be visually striking
  - Text must create curiosity ("Just Old Stones" + "(That's what I thought)" = immediate contradiction = swipe)
- **Slides 8-10 = Algorithm gold:** Instagram prioritizes carousels that get full completion
  - Save emotional climax for Slide 8 (people who make it here are invested)
  - Slide 9 = payoff/insight (reward for swiping through)
  - Slide 10 = practical value + CTA (maximizes saves)

**Engagement Hacks:**
- **Pin top comment immediately after posting:** "This place broke something open in me. Have you ever been somewhere that put your entire life in perspective?"
- **Add location tag:** Tag "Gonio Fortress" (helps with local discovery)
- **Share to Stories 30 min after posting:** Reshare Slide 1 with poll sticker: "Have you heard of Gonio Fortress? 🤔 Yes / No"
- **Respond to first 5 comments within 10 minutes:** Algorithm boost for early engagement

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Posting during dead zones (2-4 AM, 11 AM-1 PM when people are busy)
- ❌ All slides looking identical (visual monotony kills completion rate)
- ❌ Too much text per slide (people won't read walls of text—aim for 15-20 words max per slide)
- ❌ Weak Slide 1 (no second chance to make first impression)

## A/B TEST VARIATIONS

Consider testing these alternate approaches on future carousels:

### Test 1: Text Density
- **Version A (Current):** 15-20 words per slide, balanced with image
- **Version B:** Minimal text (5-7 words), let images dominate
- **Track:** Which gets higher completion rate and saves

### Test 2: Slide 1 Hook Variations
- **Version A (Current):** "Just Old Stones / (That's what I thought)"
- **Version B:** "2000 Years Old / And you can touch it"
- **Version C:** "Romans in Georgia? / Yeah, I didn't know either"
- **Track:** Which gets higher swipe-through rate (compare impressions Slide 1 vs Slide 2)

### Test 3: Color Scheme
- **Version A (Current):** Warm/earthy (beige, terracotta, cream)
- **Version B:** Cool/dramatic (deep blues, grays, high contrast)
- **Track:** Which aesthetic drives more saves (indicates perceived value)

### Test 4: CTA Placement
- **Version A (Current):** CTA in Slide 10 + caption
- **Version B:** CTA in caption only, Slide 10 = pure reflection
- **Track:** Which drives more link clicks

**How to Track:**
- Instagram Insights → Carousel metrics
- Check "Forward" taps (Slide 1→2→3...) vs "Back" taps
- High "Forward" taps = strong hook, good content flow
- High "Back" taps = something confused or lost them
- **Goal:** 60%+ reach Slide 10, 30%+ save the post

## SUCCESS METRICS

**Primary KPIs:**
1. **Saves:** Target 8-12% save rate (indicates evergreen value—people want to reference later)
2. **Carousel completion rate:** Target 60%+ reach Slide 10 (strong narrative pull)
3. **Shares:** Target 2-4% share rate (indicates emotional resonance—people want to show friends)

**Secondary KPIs:**
4. **Comments:** Target 100+ thoughtful comments (not just emojis—people sharing their own stories)
5. **Reach:** Target 150%+ of follower count (indicates Explore page pickup)
6. **Profile visits:** Target 5-8% (indicates "who is this person?" curiosity)

**Engagement Quality Indicators (more important than vanity metrics):**
- ✅ Comments sharing personal experiences at historical sites
- ✅ Questions about travel to Georgia
- ✅ Emotional reactions ("This gave me chills", "I'm crying", etc.)
- ✅ Tags to friends ("We HAVE to go here")
- ✅ Debate/discussion in comments (about Romans, history, travel philosophy)

**Red Flags:**
- 🚩 High drop-off between Slides 1-3 (hook isn't working)
- 🚩 Comments are all emojis/generic ("Beautiful!", "😍") = superficial engagement
- 🚩 Low saves despite high likes = entertaining but not valuable
- 🚩 No profile visits = content didn't make them curious about YOU
