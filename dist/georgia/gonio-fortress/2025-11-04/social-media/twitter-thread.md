## FULL THREAD

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
I'm standing next to stones that are TWO THOUSAND YEARS OLD.

Roman soldiers touched these exact same blocks I'm touching right now.

And I can't stop thinking—what the hell were they doing way out here?

### Tweet 2 (Setup)
Context: I'm in Georgia (the country, not the state).

Got here for 40 cents on a marshrutka from Batumi. Paid $3 to get in.

I was skeptical. Super skeptical.

I thought it'd be just... foundations. Stones on the ground. Imagination work.

I was so wrong.

### Tweet 3 (Discovery)
The moment I stepped inside, I felt it.

900 meters of walls. 18 towers still standing. And you can CLIMB them. Like, actually climb the stone staircases Roman soldiers used.

Touch the same walls they touched.

Most historical sites rope everything off.

Not here.

### Tweet 4 (Sensory Detail)
I'm climbing this tower and the stones under my feet are worn down from two thousand years of footsteps.

Roman footsteps.
Byzantine footsteps.
Ottoman footsteps.

All these empires, all these soldiers climbing the exact same stairs.

### Tweet 5 (The View)
When you get to the top... holy shit.

On one side: Black Sea stretching forever
On the other: Snow-capped Caucasus mountains

I stood there thinking—yeah. YEAH. I get why they built a fortress here.

This location is insane.

### Tweet 6 (History in Layers)
Here's what blew my mind.

You can literally see history in LAYERS.

Bottom: Massive Roman blocks (1st century AD)
Middle: Byzantine reinforcements
Top: Ottoman mortar

Three empires. One wall. All visible. All right here.

I stared at this for 20 minutes.

### Tweet 7 (The Mystery)
There's a marble tomb in the center.

Fresh flowers. Lit candles. Left TODAY.

Legend says it's the Apostle Matthias—one of Christ's disciples—buried right here.

But nobody knows for sure. The government won't allow excavations.

It stays sealed. Forever.

### Tweet 8 (Emotional Climax)
I wasn't expecting this place to hit me like this.

But sitting on those walls, I started thinking about everyone who stood here before me. Roman legionnaires. Byzantine soldiers. Ottoman guards.

And then tourists like me with our phones.

We're all just passing through.

### Tweet 9 (Reflection + CTA)
My nine years of traveling? That's nothing. That's a blink.

These walls have seen empires rise and fall. Languages change. Religions change.

And they're still here. Still standing.

Places like this put your whole life in perspective.

## POSTING STRATEGY

**Best time to post:**
- Primary: 8-10 AM EST (when US East Coast is starting work, checking phones)
- Backup: 6-8 PM EST (evening scroll time)

**Pin this tweet:** No - but consider quote tweeting the thread 2 hours later with: "The craziest part? This place cost me $3.40 total. Forty cents for transport, $3 entrance. Two thousand years of history for the price of a coffee."

**Engagement tactics:**
- Reply to your own thread 2 hours later with: "Oh and I forgot to mention—there are babushkas hanging laundry literally behind these Roman towers. Soviet apartments right next to 1st century AD walls. The juxtaposition is WILD."
- Ask a question in final tweet to drive comments: "Have you ever been somewhere that made your whole life feel like a blink? Where?"
- Share specific photos with each tweet to increase engagement (tower view, wall layers, tomb)

**Hashtags (use sparingly, max 1-2 in final tweet only):**
- #TravelGeorgia
- #RomanHistory

**Alternative final tweet with question CTA:**
"My nine years of traveling? That's nothing. That's a blink.

These walls have seen empires rise and fall. Languages change. Religions change.

And they're still here. Still standing.

Have you ever been somewhere that made you feel this small? Where?"

## ALTERNATIVE HOOKS (A/B Test)

**Hook Option 2 (Question-led):**
"What were Roman soldiers doing on the coast of Georgia—the country, not the state—in the first century AD?

I spent an hour at Gonio Fortress trying to understand.

Thread about touching stones that are 2000 years old 👇"

**Hook Option 3 (Vulnerable opening):**
"I wasn't expecting to cry at a fortress.

But here's the thing about standing next to stones that Roman soldiers touched 2000 years ago.

It puts your entire life in perspective.

Thread about Gonio Fortress, Georgia 👇"

**Recommendation:** Use Hook 1 (the default above). It's the most immediate, visceral, and creates the strongest curiosity gap. The repetition of "two thousand years old" and "exact same blocks" creates tactile urgency.
