---

## HOOK (0:00-0:10)

**VISUAL**: Lilia standing beside the massive Mother of Georgia statue, looking up at it with a slightly unimpressed expression.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA, bluntly)**:
"So everyone told me I had to see this statue. Mother of Georgia. Kartlis Deda. Icon of Tbilisi. And honestly? Up close? It's kinda... underwhelming."

**VISUAL**: Quick cut to Lilia turning around, away from the statue, revealing the breathtaking panoramic view of Tbilisi spread below.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"But then you turn around."

**VISUAL**: Sweeping panorama - Old Town, Narikala Fortress, the Mtkvari River, modern Tbilisi stretching to mountains.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA, genuine smile)**:
"Oh. Okay. Now I get it."

---

## ACT 1: THE JOURNEY UP (0:10-2:30)

**VISUAL**: Cable car station at Rike Park. Lilia getting into a glass cabin.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"Alright so, to get to Mother of Georgia, you take this cable car from Rike Park. It's like five lari or something. Super cheap. And the ride itself is actually beautiful."

**VISUAL**: Cable car ascending over Old Town. Aerial views through the glass cabin - terracotta roofs, church domes, winding streets.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"You're gliding over the city. You can see into people's balconies, over church roofs, across the river. It's peaceful. It's quiet. Just the hum of the cable and the view getting bigger and bigger."

**VISUAL**: Arriving at Narikala Fortress station. Lilia exiting the cable car.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA, walking)**:
"You get off at Narikala Fortress, and then it's like a five-minute walk to the statue. Except—spoiler—it's uphill. Everything in Tbilisi is uphill. I swear this city is like 80% stairs."

**VISUAL**: Walking along the path, Narikala Fortress walls visible, other tourists heading the same direction.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"But the walk is fine. You're on this ridge with the fortress on one side and the city spreading out below. And you start seeing the statue in the distance. This big figure on the hilltop. Bowl in one hand, sword in the other."

**VISUAL**: First distant view of Mother of Georgia silhouetted against the sky.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"And I'm thinking, 'Okay, this is gonna be epic. Twenty meters tall. Iconic. This is THE Tbilisi monument.'"

---

## ACT 2: THE DISAPPOINTMENT (2:30-4:30)

**VISUAL**: Arriving at the statue viewing area. Getting closer to the monument.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA, approaching)**:
"And then you get here. And... hmm."

**VISUAL**: Walking around the base of the statue. Looking up at it from different angles.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"So here's the thing. Mother of Georgia—Kartlis Deda—she's 20 meters tall. Made of aluminum. Built in 1958, though they replaced it in 1997 with an identical copy. She's holding a bowl of wine in her left hand, welcoming friends. And a sword in her right hand, ready to fight enemies. Hospitality and fierce independence. That's the Georgian character, supposedly."

**VISUAL**: Close-ups of the statue showing weathered aluminum, details that look less refined up close.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA, honestly)**:
"But up close? She's not... I mean, she's big. She's definitely big. But the details? Kind of rough. The aluminum is weathered. The proportions look awkward from certain angles. And—here's the weird part—she faces away from you."

**VISUAL**: Showing how the statue faces outward toward the city, not toward visitors.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"She's looking out over Tbilisi. Which is symbolic and everything—watching over the city—but it means when you're standing here, you can't actually see her face. You see her profile. Her side. You can't get that classic frontal photo everyone posts."

**VISUAL**: Tourists trying to photograph the statue, awkwardly positioning themselves.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"And I'm standing here thinking, 'I took a cable car for this? I climbed uphill for this?' Like, it's fine. It's a statue. But it's not... it's not blowing my mind, you know?"

**VISUAL**: Vendor stalls visible in the background—souvenir sellers, trinkets, commercial atmosphere.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"Plus there's these vendor stalls everywhere. People selling magnets and keychains and overpriced Soviet flags. And it just feels... touristy. Commercial. Not the majestic national monument experience I was expecting."

**VISUAL**: Lilia looking slightly deflated, turning away from the statue.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"So I'm disappointed. I'm not gonna lie. I'm disappointed."

---

## ACT 3: THE REVELATION (4:30-7:00)

**VISUAL**: Lilia turning around, away from the statue, toward the edge of the viewing area.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"And then I turn around. And—"

**VISUAL**: The view opens up. 360-degree panorama of Tbilisi in all its glory.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA, genuine awe)**:
"Holy shit. Okay. This. This is why you come here."

**VISUAL**: Slow panoramic sweep showing the full vista.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"Narikala Fortress right there—these ancient walls that have been standing for like a thousand years. Old Town below—all those winding streets and traditional buildings. The Mtkvari River cutting through the city. The Bridge of Peace glowing white in the distance. Sameba Cathedral with its golden dome. And then modern Tbilisi spreading toward the foothills."

**VISUAL**: Different angles of the view—zooming in on specific landmarks, then pulling back to show the scope.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA, leaning on the railing)**:
"And on clear days—today's pretty clear—you can see the Caucasus Mountains on the horizon. Snow-capped peaks like 50, 60 kilometers away. Just sitting there on the edge of the world."

**VISUAL**: Attempting to capture the distant mountains through the haze.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"It's not just one view. You can walk around this whole hilltop and get 360 degrees. Every angle is different. Every angle is incredible."

**VISUAL**: Other visitors taking photos of the view, not the statue. People just standing and looking.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"And I realize—everyone here is doing the same thing. No one's actually looking at the statue. Everyone turned their backs on Mother of Georgia to look at the city. Because the view is what matters. The statue is just... the excuse to get you up here."

**VISUAL**: Lilia finding a spot to sit, just taking in the view quietly.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER, reflective)**:
"And I sit here for like twenty minutes. Just looking. And I start to understand. This isn't about the monument. It never was. It's about standing at the highest point in the city and seeing everything. Past and present. Old and new. All of Tbilisi laid out like a map."

---

## ACT 4: THE SYMBOLISM (7:00-8:30)

**VISUAL**: Back to the statue, but Lilia's perspective has shifted.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"Okay so, let me tell you about Mother of Georgia. Because once you get past the disappointment, there's actually something here."

**VISUAL**: Close-up of the bowl of wine in her left hand.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"Left hand: bowl of wine. That's Georgian hospitality. The famous Georgian generosity. Come to Georgia, we'll feed you, we'll drink with you, you're family. That's real, by the way. I've experienced that here. It's not a myth."

**VISUAL**: Close-up of the sword in her right hand.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"Right hand: sword. That's the other side. Don't fuck with us. We've been invaded by everyone—Persians, Ottomans, Russians, Soviets. But we're still here. Still Georgian. Still independent. That sword means something."

**VISUAL**: Wide shot showing both arms raised against the sky.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"So she's both. Welcoming and fierce. Hospitable and defensive. That duality—that's the whole Georgian thing. And when you understand that, the statue makes more sense."

**VISUAL**: QR code visible at the base of the statue.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA, walking over)**:
"Oh, and there's this QR code thing. You scan it and there's like a voice recording where Mother Georgia 'speaks' to you. I tried it. It's kinda cheesy but also kinda sweet. Digital engagement with Soviet-era monument. Sure, why not."

**VISUAL**: Lilia scanning the code, listening with headphones, slightly amused expression.

---

## ACT 5: THE HISTORY (8:30-9:30)

**VISUAL**: Sitting near the statue, more relaxed now.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"So here's what I didn't know. The original statue from 1958? It was wooden. Just wood. They built it for Tbilisi's 1,500th anniversary and it was supposed to be temporary."

**VISUAL**: Imagining the wooden version—archive photos if available, or just the current statue with voiceover context.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"But people loved it so much they decided to keep it. Covered it in aluminum in 1963 to protect it from weather. And then in 1997, they replaced that one with a new identical version—which is what we're looking at now. So this is technically the third version of the same statue."

**VISUAL**: Back to Lilia.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"And the sculptor—Elguja Amashukeli—he originally called it just 'Capital.' That's it. Capital. But people started calling it Mother of Kartvel, Mother of Georgia. And that name stuck. Even the artist couldn't control what his work became to people."

**VISUAL**: Looking at the statue again with this context.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"And he actually modified it later to make her more feminine. The original version was more masculine-looking. So even after it was built, it kept evolving. It's not a static thing. It's been changing for 60 years."

---

## ACT 6: PRACTICAL REALITY (9:30-10:15)

**VISUAL**: Walking back toward the cable car station.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"Okay, practical stuff. If you're coming here—and you should—here's what you need to know."

**VISUAL**: Cable car descending, Tbilisi view from inside.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"Take the cable car. Yeah, you can hike up the stairs from Betlemi Street, but it's steep and exhausting, especially in summer. The cable car is cheap, easy, and the ride itself is half the experience."

**VISUAL**: The exposed hilltop with harsh sun.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"Come early morning or late afternoon. The hilltop is completely exposed—no shade. Midday summer heat is brutal. Bring water. Bring sunscreen. Bring a hat."

**VISUAL**: Crowds of tourists during peak hours.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"Avoid weekends if you can. It gets crowded. Weekday mornings or evenings are quieter. Better for photos, better for just... being there without fighting for space."

**VISUAL**: Attempting to photograph the statue from the platform, then from below showing how it looks better from distance.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"And don't expect great photos of the statue from up close. The best shots are actually from below—from the hillside or the cable car. Up here, you're too close and she's facing the wrong way."

---

## OUTRO: ACCEPTANCE (10:15-10:45)

**VISUAL**: Lilia one last time at the viewing area, sunset starting to color the sky.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA, final thoughts)**:
"So, Mother of Georgia. Did she disappoint me? Yeah. A little. Up close, she's not as impressive as I wanted her to be. She's weathered, awkward, you can't photograph her properly. The commercial vendor stuff is annoying."

**VISUAL**: Turning to face the view one more time. Golden hour light starting.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"But you know what? I'm glad I came. Because it's not about her. It never was. It's about this place. This hilltop. This view. This feeling of standing above the city and seeing everything at once."

**VISUAL**: The city lights starting to twinkle as dusk approaches.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"She's just the guardian. The watcher. Bowl of wine, sword raised. Welcoming friends, ready for enemies. And down below? That's what she's protecting. That's Tbilisi. That's Georgia."

**VISUAL**: Final wide shot—the statue silhouetted against the sunset sky, Tbilisi glowing below.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"Sometimes the symbol matters less than what it symbolizes. Sometimes the journey matters more than the destination. And sometimes disappointment turns into something better if you just turn around and look at what's really there."

**VISUAL**: Lilia walking toward the cable car, glancing back once at the statue, then at the view, then departing.

## PRODUCTION NOTES

### Key Shots Needed:
- **Cable car journey**: Aerial views over Old Town, anticipation building
- **Approach to statue**: First sightings from distance, excitement
- **Up-close disappointment**: Weathered aluminum, awkward angles, can't see her face
- **The profile problem**: Showing how she faces away from visitors
- **Vendor stalls**: Commercial atmosphere, tourist trap vibe
- **The turn-around moment**: Revealing the panoramic view
- **360-degree panorama**: Multiple angles of the full vista
- **Distant mountains**: Caucasus peaks on horizon (if clear day)
- **Tourist behavior**: People photographing views, not statue
- **Symbolic details**: Bowl of wine, sword, raised arms against sky
- **QR code interaction**: Digital engagement with monument
- **Sunset/golden hour**: City lights beginning, beautiful light

### B-Roll Priority:
1. **The view** (this is the real star): Old Town, Narikala, river, modern Tbilisi, mountains
2. **Cable car ascent**: Glass cabin views, aerial perspective
3. **Statue from multiple angles**: Showing the proportional issues, weathering, awkward views
4. **Profile view emphasis**: How you can't see her face from the platform
5. **Vendor stalls**: Tourist commercial reality
6. **Other visitors**: Everyone focused on views, not statue
7. **Symbolic details**: Bowl and sword close-ups
8. **Comparative shots**: Statue from platform (bad angle) vs from below (better angle)
9. **Time progression**: Morning light to sunset
10. **Sololaki neighborhood**: Bonus content for the charming area below

### Music Cues:
- **0:00-2:30**: Anticipatory, building (cable car journey, approach)
- **2:30-4:30**: Slightly deflating, minor key (disappointment section)
- **4:30-7:00**: Opening up, major key, sweeping (view revelation)
- **7:00-9:30**: More contemplative, historical (symbolism and history)
- **9:30-10:45**: Resolution, acceptance (practical tips and outro)

**Note**: Music should mirror the emotional journey from anticipation → disappointment → revelation → acceptance

### Pacing Notes:
- **Quick hook**: Get to the honesty immediately ("it's underwhelming")
- **Build anticipation**: Cable car and approach should feel exciting
- **Linger on disappointment**: Don't rush past it—let it be real
- **The revelation should feel earned**: The turn-around moment needs to land
- **Slow down for the view**: Let the panoramas breathe, don't rush them
- **Pick up pace for practical section**: Information delivery mode
- **Contemplative ending**: Reflection needs space

### Emotional Beats:
1. **Anticipation** (journey): "This is gonna be epic"
2. **Confusion** (arrival): "Wait... this is it?"
3. **Disappointment** (up close): "It's kinda underwhelming"
4. **Revelation** (turn around): "Oh. OH."
5. **Appreciation** (views): "This is why you come here"
6. **Understanding** (symbolism): "Now it makes sense"
7. **Curiosity** (history): "Three versions of the same statue"
8. **Acceptance** (outro): "Glad I came anyway"

### Cinematography Techniques:

**For Disappointment Section:**
- Unflattering angles of the statue
- Show weathering, imperfections, awkward proportions
- Shoot from positions that emphasize you can only see her profile
- Include vendor stalls and tourist crowds (detracting from monumentality)

**For Revelation Section:**
- Slow pans revealing the panorama
- Wide establishing shots showing scope
- Time-lapses of clouds moving over the city
- Drone shots if available (aerial context of hilltop position)
- Golden hour light on the city

**Contrast Technique:**
Throughout, emphasize the contrast:
- Expectation (promotional images) vs Reality (actual viewing experience)
- Statue (underwhelming) vs View (breathtaking)
- Up close (disappointing) vs From distance (better)

## THEMATIC ELEMENTS

### Theme 1: Expectations vs Reality
- Promotional images create expectations the reality doesn't meet
- Monument is less impressive than its reputation suggests
- But reality (the view) exceeds expectations in different ways

### Theme 2: Symbol vs What It Symbolizes
- The statue itself is underwhelming
- But what it represents (Georgian character, watching over the city) has meaning
- The view of Tbilisi matters more than the guardian figure

### Theme 3: Journey to Acceptance
- Initial excitement → disappointment → discovery → appreciation
- Learning to find value in unexpected places
- Adjusting expectations leads to better experiences

### Theme 4: Location > Object
- The hilltop position matters more than the monument
- Views trump artistic quality
- Sometimes the setting is the attraction

### Theme 5: Honest Travel Content
- Admitting disappointment rather than pretending everything is amazing
- "Underwhelming" doesn't mean "not worth it"
- Nuanced takes are more valuable than hyperbole

*"So everyone told me I had to see this statue. Mother of Georgia. Icon of Tbilisi. And honestly? Up close? It's kinda... underwhelming."*

### Option B: The Reveal
*"This is what everyone photographs from below. [Shows promotional image] And this is what you actually see when you get there. [Shows profile view, weathered surface]"*

### Option C: Contradiction Hook

## FINAL NOTE: THE SOLOLAKI BONUS

Consider adding a 1-2 minute bonus section about the Sololaki neighborhood (can be edited as separate content or kept as full video ending):

**VISUAL**: Walking down from the statue into the charming neighborhood below

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"Oh, and one more thing. The neighborhood right below the statue—Sololaki—it's beautiful. Like, genuinely beautiful."

**VISUAL**: 19th-century European mansions, trendy cafes, art galleries, craft bars

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"These are 19th-century merchant mansions. Wealthy Georgians built European-style homes here. And now they're cafes, wine bars, galleries. It's the trendy part of Tbilisi. And most tourists skip it because they're rushing to the next monument."

**VISUAL**: Stopping at a cafe, getting coffee, sitting outside

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"So if you come up here for Mother of Georgia, give yourself time to wander down through Sololaki after. Have coffee. Explore the streets. Discover something that's not on the tourist map."
