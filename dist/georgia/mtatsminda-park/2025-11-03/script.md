## HOOK (0:00-0:15)

**[VISUAL: Close-up of Lilia in vintage funicular car, city sprawling behind through window, track climbing steeply]**

Okay so, this funicular—from 1905, like literally 1905—it's climbing straight up this mountain at a thirty-degree angle and I'm in this creaky vintage car and Tbilisi is just... dropping away below me. And I'm thinking: why did a Soviet secret police chief build an amusement park on top of a holy mountain?

Like, that's a real question.

**[MUSIC: Upbeat, slightly mysterious]**

---

## ACT 1: THE ASCENT (0:15-2:00)

### SEGMENT 1: The Journey Begins (0:15-0:45)

**[VISUAL: Wide shot of lower funicular station in central Tbilisi, crowds waiting]**

Here's the thing about Mtatsminda Park. You can't just walk there. I mean you can, there are trails, but most people take this funicular railway that's been running since 1905. Belgian engineer designed it. French and Georgian architects built it. And it climbs 267 meters—that's like an 80-story building—in three minutes.

**[VISUAL: Inside funicular car ascending, mechanical sounds prominent]**

So I'm standing in line on a Thursday afternoon—avoided the weekend crowds, thank god—and I pay 10 lari, about three-fifty USD, for a one-way ticket up. The car is packed with Georgian families, kids absolutely losing their minds with excitement, and we start moving.

**[VISUAL: Track climbing through tunnel, then emerging to reveal expanding city views]**

And immediately it gets steep. Like, really steep. Twenty-eight to thirty-three degrees the whole way up. The mechanical systems are whirring and creaking—these are the sounds of vintage engineering, right?—and through the windows, Tbilisi is spreading out below us.

**[AUDIO: Natural sound of funicular machinery, children's voices]**

### SEGMENT 2: The View Opens (0:45-1:30)

**[VISUAL: Funicular climbing through open sections, panoramic views through windows]**

I wasn't expecting this. I thought the funicular was just transportation, you know? But it's actually an attraction itself. We're passing through tunnels and then suddenly bursting into open air with the whole city visible—the Mtkvari River snaking through, those colorful balconies I love, the Bridge of Peace glowing even in daylight.

**[VISUAL: Close-up of Lilia watching through window, golden light on her face]**

A Georgian grandmother sitting next to me says something I don't understand, gestures to the window, and smiles. That knowing smile like: "Wait till you get to the top."

I smile back. No words we both understand, just... anticipation, you know?

**[VISUAL: Funicular approaching upper station, park visible ahead]**

### SEGMENT 3: Arrival & First Impressions (1:30-2:00)

**[VISUAL: Upper station platform, families exiting, park entrance ahead]**

Three minutes later—exactly three minutes—we arrive at the upper station. 770 meters above sea level. The highest point in Tbilisi.

**[VISUAL: Wide establishing shot of park entrance with pine trees, pathways, TV tower visible]**

And stepping out onto the platform, the first thing that hits me is the temperature. It's like five to ten degrees cooler up here. I'm immediately glad I brought a jacket because the breeze—there's this constant mountain breeze that just cuts through you.

The second thing is the smell. Pine trees. Like actual pine forest. Mixed with... popcorn and cotton candy and grilled food. It's this bizarre combination of mountain wilderness and Soviet-era carnival.

**[VISUAL: Lilia walking into park, rides visible in background, families everywhere]**

And I'm standing here thinking: this place has layers. Like serious historical layers I wasn't ready for.

**[MUSIC: Shifts to nostalgic, slightly whimsical]**

---

## ACT 2: EXPLORING THE LAYERS (2:00-6:30)

### SEGMENT 4: Soviet Heritage (2:00-3:15)

**[VISUAL: Various vintage rides—carousel, bumper cars, older attractions]**

Okay so, storytime. This park? Founded by Lavrentiy Beria in the 1930s.

Lavrentiy Beria.

**[VISUAL: Close-up of Lilia's face, serious expression]**

If you know Soviet history, that name just... it makes your stomach drop. Stalin's secret police chief. Notorious. Absolutely notorious. And before all that horror, when he was head of the Tbilisi City Committee, he ordered all the existing buildings on this mountaintop demolished to create a "family recreation destination."

**[VISUAL: Wide shots of park, families enjoying rides, juxtaposed with vintage aesthetic]**

And it worked. During Soviet times, this was the third most visited public park in the entire USSR. People came from all over—Moscow, Leningrad, Kyiv—to ride this funicular and walk around this mountaintop.

**[VISUAL: Vintage ride mechanisms, retro signage]**

So there's this weird cognitive dissonance happening in my brain. I'm watching Georgian kids scream with joy on rides that have been here since Soviet times. The aesthetic is pure retro—faded paint, vintage mechanisms, that nostalgic carnival music playing from speakers.

**[VISUAL: Close-up of old ride controls, weathered paint]**

And I'm thinking about who built this. Who ordered this. The darkness behind the decision.

But also... generations of families have made memories here. Decades of joy. Of first dates and childhood wonder and those universal moments of holding your parent's hand on a scary ride.

**[VISUAL: Georgian family with small children getting on carousel]**

History is complicated. History is so fucking complicated.

### SEGMENT 5: The Ferris Wheel & The View (3:15-4:45)

**[VISUAL: Walking toward the 65-meter Ferris wheel positioned at mountain edge]**

Alright, let's talk about the actual star of this place. And it's not the rides.

**[VISUAL: Wide shot of Ferris wheel against sky and city backdrop]**

It's this.

The Ferris wheel is sixty-five meters tall—about twenty stories—and it's positioned right at the edge of the mountain. Like literally at the edge. So when you're in those cabins, you're suspended above Tbilisi with nothing but air between you and the city below.

**[VISUAL: Getting into Ferris wheel cabin, paying with ride card]**

I paid ten lari—charged it to my ride card at the entrance, which by the way can only be recharged at the entrance, so load enough money because you don't want to walk all the way back—and I climb into this cabin.

**[VISUAL: Cabin ascending, Lilia alone or with one other person, filming through plexiglass]**

And we start rising.

And rising.

And oh my god.

**[VISUAL: 360-degree panoramic views of Tbilisi from cabin]**

**[MUSIC: Swells to emotional, expansive]**

Okay. Okay so. Three hundred sixty degrees of Tbilisi. The whole city. Every direction. The Mtkvari River winding through like this silver ribbon. Narikala Fortress up on that ridge. The Holy Trinity Cathedral absolutely massive against the skyline. All those colorful balconies stacked on hillsides. The Bridge of Peace. The Old Town with its narrow streets I've gotten lost in so many times.

**[VISUAL: Slow rotation showing different angles of city, golden hour light beginning]**

And I'm alone in this cabin—I got lucky, solo rider—and I'm just... I'm quiet. Completely quiet. Which if you know me, you know that's rare.

**[AUDIO: Natural sound—wind, distant carnival music below, creaking of Ferris wheel]**

This is what I came for. Not the rides. This. This perspective. Seeing the city I've been living in—my eighth base country, by the way—spread out like a map. Like I can trace my daily route from my apartment in Vera to the markets in Sololaki to my favorite cafes near Rustaveli.

**[VISUAL: Close-up of Lilia's face, emotional, reflective]**

Here's the thing about being a nomad. You spend so much time just... wandering. Street level. Lost half the time. And then you get this view—this bird's eye view—and suddenly the whole puzzle clicks together. Like: oh, that's how it all connects. That's the shape of my temporary home.

**[VISUAL: Cabin descending, sunset beginning, city bathed in golden light]**

### SEGMENT 6: The Art Deco Restaurant & Ghosts of Prestige (4:45-5:45)

**[VISUAL: Walking to the Funicular Restaurant, Art Deco building from 1938]**

So I need to tell you about this restaurant.

**[VISUAL: Exterior of restaurant building, architectural details]**

The Funicular Restaurant. Built in 1938. Pure Art Deco. And back in the day—Soviet day—this was the place to be. Like the prestige venue.

Fidel Castro ate here.

Margaret Thatcher ate here.

Alain Delon—the French actor—ate here.

**[VISUAL: Interior of restaurant, tables with city views through large windows]**

And I'm sitting at this table by the window, looking at the same view those historical figures saw, and I order khinkali and a glass of Georgian wine because when in Georgia, right?

**[VISUAL: Food arriving, wine glass, city view]**

Now. Let me be honest. The food is... okay. Just okay. Like the setting is incredible—ten out of ten for ambiance—but the khinkali are maybe a six. Not bad, just not memorable. The wine is good though. Georgian wine is always good.

**[VISUAL: Lilia eating, looking thoughtful]**

But here's what I'm thinking about. This building hosted world leaders and celebrities when Georgia was part of the Soviet Union. When Tbilisi was this important cultural center. And now it's a family restaurant where kids are running around and Georgian parents are trying to have quiet conversations and tourists like me are taking photos of the Art Deco lighting fixtures.

**[VISUAL: Vintage architectural details—light fixtures, molding, windows]**

The prestige is still there, kind of. Faded but present. Like the rides outside—vintage charm, not cutting-edge quality.

And you know what? I kind of love that. The unpretentious reality of it.

### SEGMENT 7: The Forest Within (5:45-6:30)

**[VISUAL: Walking away from rides into forest trails, natural setting]**

Okay so this is the surreal part. Ready?

You're at an amusement park. Carnival music playing. Rides whirring. Kids screaming. Cotton candy vendors calling out.

And then you walk like... two hundred meters down a forest path.

**[VISUAL: Deep in forest trail, dappled sunlight through pine trees]**

And all that noise? Gone.

**[AUDIO: Natural sound only—rustling leaves, bird songs, footsteps on dirt path]**

I'm standing in a pine forest. Over one hundred hectares total, with most of it just... wild. Mountain ecology. Natural vegetation. Shaded trails where the only sounds are birds and leaves and my own footsteps.

**[VISUAL: Lilia walking slowly through forest, touching tree trunk]**

There's this moment where I literally forget I'm at an amusement park. The funicular feels like a different world. The Ferris wheel feels like something I imagined.

**[VISUAL: Looking up through pine branches at sky]**

And then I hear it—distant screams from a roller coaster or drop tower—and reality snaps back.

**[VISUAL: Walking back toward rides, forest path opening to carnival area]**

It's this weird juxtaposition. Soviet amusement park meets actual holy mountain wilderness. Both existing in the same space.

Mount Mtatsminda. "Holy Mountain" in Georgian. Religious history going back centuries before Beria ever showed up with his demolition orders.

The mountain remembers.

**[MUSIC: Transitions to more energetic, anticipatory]**

---

## ACT 3: TWILIGHT TRANSFORMATION (6:30-8:00)

### SEGMENT 8: The Golden Hour (6:30-7:15)

**[VISUAL: Sun beginning to set, golden light bathing entire park and city]**

Alright so. The locals told me: arrive late afternoon. Experience three stages. Daylight, sunset, and nighttime illumination.

And I listened. For once in my chaotic life, I actually listened to local advice.

**[VISUAL: Wide shots of park in golden hour light, long shadows, warm tones]**

It's like six-thirty pm. November in Georgia, so sunset comes early. And the light—god, the light.

**[VISUAL: City bathed in golden sunset, Mtkvari River glowing]**

Everything turns gold. The river down below is reflecting this liquid gold. The buildings—all those colorful balconies—they're glowing like they're lit from within. The mountains in the distance, the Caucasus range, they're turning purple and pink.

**[VISUAL: Families gathering at viewpoints, phones out, quiet appreciation]**

And everyone in the park kind of stops. Like this collective pause. Georgian families, tourists, couples, everyone just stops to watch.

**[VISUAL: Close-up of Lilia's face, golden light, emotional]**

I'm standing at this viewpoint near the Ferris wheel and I'm just... I'm overwhelmed. Like legitimately overwhelmed.

**[AUDIO: Natural sound—wind, distant soft conversations, carousel music fading]**

### SEGMENT 9: The Illuminated Night (7:15-8:00)

**[VISUAL: Dusk transitioning to darkness, first lights turning on]**

And then.

Then the lights start coming on.

**[VISUAL: Time-lapse or jump cuts showing progressive illumination]**

First the rides. The Ferris wheel lighting up—all those colored bulbs. The carousel glowing. Every attraction outlined in lights.

**[VISUAL: TV tower beginning to illuminate in rainbow colors]**

Then the TV tower. That 275-meter triangular tower they call "Andza"—the Spindle. It starts glowing in rainbow colors. Like an actual rainbow. Cycling through the spectrum.

**[VISUAL: City lights turning on below, Tbilisi illuminated at night]**

And down in the city, Tbilisi wakes up in lights. Every building, every street, every bridge—all illuminated. The whole city twinkling like some ridiculous fairytale.

**[VISUAL: Wide shot from viewpoint—illuminated park in foreground, glowing city below, dark mountains in background]**

**[MUSIC: Builds to emotional peak]**

And I'm standing here—I've been here for three hours now, somehow it's been three hours—and I'm thinking about all the people who've stood in this exact spot.

Soviet families in the 1950s, watching their city from this mountaintop.

International celebrities in the Art Deco restaurant.

Georgian kids over decades—multiple generations—coming up on that funicular for their first Ferris wheel ride.

**[VISUAL: Close-up of Lilia, reflective, night lights in background]**

And now me. Lilia from Siberia. Nine years a nomad. Thirty-plus countries. Currently based in Tbilisi, my eighth home.

Standing on a holy mountain turned amusement park by a secret police chief, watching a city I've learned to love light up like a constellation.

**[VISUAL: Rides operating at night, families still enjoying attractions]**

The dated rides don't matter. The vintage aesthetic, the operational inconveniences—the ride card that can only be charged at the entrance, the log flume with safety concerns, the stray dogs wandering the forest paths.

None of that matters.

**[VISUAL: Ferris wheel rotating against night sky and city lights]**

Because this. This view. This transformation from day to night. This feeling of being suspended above a city that's shown me so much.

This is why you come.

**[MUSIC: Peaks and then softens]**

---

## OUTRO (8:00-8:45)

### SEGMENT 10: The Descent & Reflection (8:00-8:45)

**[VISUAL: Walking toward funicular lower station at night, park still glowing]**

It's almost nine pm when I finally decide to leave. I could stay longer—the park stays open—but I'm cold now, genuinely cold, and I've absorbed everything I can.

**[VISUAL: Inside funicular car descending, night city visible through window]**

The funicular ride down is completely different than going up. The city is fully dark now. And we're descending toward all those lights—toward home, basically.

**[VISUAL: View through funicular window of Tbilisi at night]**

And I'm thinking about something one of the locals told me. An artist named Nina. She said Mtatsminda is "more than just a park—it's a symbol of Tbilisi's beauty, resilience, and spirit. A place where memories are made, stories are told, and dreams take flight."

**[VISUAL: Funicular descending through lit sections and dark sections]**

And at first I thought that was just poetic exaggeration, you know? Tourism speak.

But no. No, she was right.

**[VISUAL: Lower station approaching, city level]**

This place is layers. Soviet history and Georgian spirituality. Dark origins and decades of innocent joy. Vintage charm and contemporary life. Mountain wilderness and amusement park chaos.

**[VISUAL: Exiting funicular at lower station, back in central Tbilisi]**

And somewhere in all those contradictions, there's something true about Georgia itself. About this whole complicated, beautiful, resilient country that keeps surprising me.

**[VISUAL: Walking into Tbilisi streets at night, looking back up at illuminated mountaintop]**

Ten lari to go up. About three-fifty USD. Three hours of wandering. One sunset I'll remember for years.

**[VISUAL: Close-up of Lilia, street lights, final thoughts]**

You know what though? I came here thinking it was just an amusement park. Tourist attraction. Check the box.

But I'm leaving with something else entirely.

**[VISUAL: Wide shot of TV tower glowing on mountaintop visible from street level]**

A perspective. Literally and metaphorically.

Sometimes you need to climb up to understand what you've been walking through.

**[MUSIC: Fades out]**

**[SCREEN: End card with practical information]**
