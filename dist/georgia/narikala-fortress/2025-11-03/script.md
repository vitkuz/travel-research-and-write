## HOOK (0:00-0:15)

**VISUAL**: Split-screen or quick cuts between two approaches to the fortress:
- LEFT: Lilia in cable car with glass floor, dramatic aerial view below
- RIGHT: Lilia climbing steep stone stairs, sweating, breathing hard

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"There are two ways to reach Narikala Fortress. The easy way..."

**VISUAL**: Cable car gliding smoothly over terracotta roofs.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"...and the way that makes you question your life choices."

**VISUAL**: Steep stairs continuing upward, no end in sight.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA, at the top, slightly out of breath)**:
"I did both. Because I'm thorough. Or masochistic. Probably both."

**VISUAL**: Wide establishing shot of Narikala Fortress ruins against Tbilisi cityscape.

---

## ACT 1: THE CABLE CAR JOURNEY (0:15-2:30)

**VISUAL**: Rike Park cable car station. Modern, clean, tourists queuing.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"Okay so, cable car first. It's like 2.5 lari—that's less than a dollar. And it's not just transportation. It's an experience."

**VISUAL**: Getting into the glass cabin. Close-up of the transparent floor.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA, genuine excitement)**:
"Look at this. Glass floor. Like, full glass floor. You can see straight down to the streets below. If you're afraid of heights, this is... this is gonna be challenging."

**VISUAL**: Cable car starting to move. Camera shows the view through the floor—rooftops, streets, people shrinking below.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"And then you start moving. And Tbilisi just... unfolds. You're gliding over Old Town. Terracotta roofs everywhere. Church domes. The Mtkvari River winding through the city. It's silent up here except for the cable hum. Peaceful. Surreal."

**VISUAL**: Views from the cable car windows—360 degrees of Tbilisi.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA, inside the cabin)**:
"The ride is only like two minutes. 686 meters. But honestly? This might be my favorite two minutes in Tbilisi. Just floating above the city, watching it all spread out beneath you."

**VISUAL**: Approaching the fortress. Ancient stone walls getting closer. The cable car station at the top.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"And then you arrive. At this ancient fortress. 1,700 years old. And you step out of this futuristic glass capsule into ruins from the 4th century. The time clash is wild."

---

## ACT 2: FIRST IMPRESSIONS - THE RUINS (2:30-4:30)

**VISUAL**: Stepping out of the cable car station. First view of the fortress walls.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA, walking)**:
"So, Narikala. It's not what you might expect. Because here's the thing—it's ruins. Like, actual ruins. Not a restored castle with rooms to explore and exhibits. Just... walls. Beautiful, ancient, crumbling walls."

**VISUAL**: Walking along the fortress walls. Limestone blocks weathered by centuries.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"The fortress was built in the 4th century by Persians. Then the Arabs expanded it in the 7th century. Then Georgians, then Mongols—everyone who conquered Tbilisi added their own walls, their own towers. It's been called three different names over the centuries."

**VISUAL**: Close-up of different construction techniques visible in the walls—limestone, brick, mortar from different eras.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA, touching the stone)**:
"And you can see the layers. Like, this section? That's 8th century Arab construction. This part? Maybe 16th, 17th century. It's architectural history written in stone."

**VISUAL**: The ruined sections—walls without roofs, empty spaces where buildings once stood.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"In 1827, there was this massive earthquake. Plus a gunpowder explosion—they were storing munitions here. And it destroyed most of the inner fortress. The royal palace, the barracks, everything. Gone. Only the outer walls survived."

**VISUAL**: Lilia standing in an empty courtyard area, surrounded by walls but no interior structures.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"So what you're looking at now is basically the skeleton. The shell. And some people might find that disappointing. But I don't know. There's something honest about ruins. They don't pretend. They just exist, showing their age, their damage, their survival."

---

## ACT 3: THE VIEWS (4:30-6:30)

**VISUAL**: Walking to the main viewpoint area. Other tourists gathered at the railings.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"But let me tell you what Narikala is actually about. It's not about the fortress. It never was."

**VISUAL**: Turning to face outward. The view opens up—Tbilisi sprawling in all directions.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"It's about this."

**VISUAL**: Slow panoramic sweep of the entire cityscape.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA, at the railing)**:
"This is why everyone comes here. The view. From up here, you can see everything. Old Town directly below—all those winding streets and balconies. The Bridge of Peace crossing the river. Sameba Cathedral with its golden dome. The modern districts spreading toward the mountains."

**VISUAL**: Different angles of the panorama—zoom in on specific landmarks, then pull back to show the scope.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"And it's 360 degrees. You walk around these walls and every angle gives you something different. The city unfolds in layers—old and new, traditional and modern, all coexisting."

**VISUAL**: Lilia finding a quieter spot away from the main tourist cluster.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA, more contemplative)**:
"I think that's the real power of ancient fortresses. They put you above everything. They give you perspective—literally. You're standing where Persian soldiers stood 1,700 years ago, looking at the same river valley. Except they were watching for invaders and I'm watching tourists take selfies at the Bridge of Peace."

**VISUAL**: Time-lapse showing clouds moving across the sky, shadows shifting across the city.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"I sit here for like half an hour. Just watching. The light changes. The sounds from the city float up—church bells, traffic, voices. Birds circle overhead. And you feel connected to this long thread of history. Everyone who ever stood here, looking out over Tbilisi."

---

## ACT 4: ST. NICHOLAS CHURCH (6:30-7:30)

**VISUAL**: Walking toward the reconstructed church inside the fortress grounds.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"Oh, so there's also a church here. St. Nicholas Church. And this is interesting."

**VISUAL**: Exterior of the church—small, simple, traditional Georgian Orthodox style.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"The original church was built in the 13th century. It survived for like 700 years. And then it burned down. Completely destroyed by fire. So in 1996, they rebuilt it. Exact same spot. Traditional Georgian style."

**VISUAL**: Entering the church (if permitted). Interior frescoes covering the walls.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA, inside or just outside)**:
"And the frescoes inside? They're gorgeous. Vivid colors. Biblical scenes mixed with Georgian history. It's modern art following ancient traditions. Like the fortress itself—layers of time meeting in one place."

**VISUAL**: Close-ups of the frescoes if possible—saints, historical figures, elaborate patterns.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"I'm not religious, but there's something about these Orthodox churches. The incense smell, the candlelight, the way sound echoes. It creates this atmosphere that transcends belief. You feel it even if you're just a tourist with a camera."

---

## ACT 5: THE HIKE DOWN (7:30-9:30)

**VISUAL**: Lilia leaving the fortress area, heading toward the stairs that descend into Old Town.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"Okay so, I took the cable car up. But I'm walking down. Because everyone says the hike through Old Town is worth it. And also because I need to see what I spared myself by taking the cable car."

**VISUAL**: Starting down the Betlemi Street stairs. Steep, stone steps, uneven.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"These are the stairs most people take if they hike up. They're called the Betlemi Street stairs. And they're... they're no joke."

**VISUAL**: Descending through narrow streets. Traditional houses with wooden balconies, laundry hanging, cats sleeping in doorways.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA, walking)**:
"But here's the thing. Going through these neighborhoods? This is Tbilisi. Real Tbilisi. Not tourist Tbilisi. These are people's homes. Old ladies watching from balconies. Kids playing in the alleys. The smell of food cooking."

**VISUAL**: Passing a small neighborhood church, a grandmother sweeping her doorstep, architectural details of old houses.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"The cable car gives you the aerial view—the big picture. But the stairs give you the details. The textures. The human scale. Both are worth it. Different experiences of the same city."

**VISUAL**: Halfway down, stopping to look back up at the fortress walls towering above.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"And looking back up at the fortress from here? You understand why it's called a fortress. It's imposing. Intimidating. Built to dominate. From up there, you're admiring the view. From down here, you're reminded that walls like that were built to keep people out. Or keep them in."

**VISUAL**: Continuing down, getting closer to the sulfur baths district at the base of the hill.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"The fortress sits right above Abanotubani—the sulfur baths district. So you're descending from this ancient military structure into this historic bathing area. Architecture of power above, architecture of relaxation below."

**VISUAL**: Emerging at the bottom near the sulfur baths. Tilework, domed bathhouse roofs, tourists in the square.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA, at the bottom, slightly sweaty from the walk)**:
"And there you go. From fortress to bathhouses in 15 minutes. And my calves are burning. So yeah, cable car up, stairs down. That's my recommendation."

---

## ACT 6: THE HIDDEN ELEMENTS (9:30-10:30)

**VISUAL**: B-roll of elements many tourists miss—hidden towers, secluded alcoves, lesser-known viewpoints.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"So there's a lot at Narikala that most people miss. Like, there are hidden watch towers in the hillside. Most tourists don't even know they're there."

**VISUAL**: The Mother of Georgia statue visible near the fortress.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"And the Mother of Georgia statue is right there, next to the fortress. Same hilltop. So you can visit both in one trip."

**VISUAL**: Evening footage—the fortress walls illuminated by lights.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"And apparently there's a light show after sunset. The fortress lights up. I didn't know about this until after I'd already left. So that's on my list for next time."

**VISUAL**: Old archival or recent footage of tunnel entrances if available.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"Oh, and there are tunnels. Underground tunnels beneath the fortress. Secret passages for defense and escape. You can only see them with a guided tour, which I didn't do. But that's pretty cool. The fortress isn't just what you see above ground."

---

## ACT 7: RENOVATION REALITY (10:30-11:00)

**VISUAL**: Signs indicating renovation, closed-off sections, construction equipment if visible.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"Real talk: when you're watching this, the fortress might be closed. Or partially closed. It's undergoing major renovations that are supposed to finish by end of summer 2025."

**VISUAL**: Showing areas with structural concerns—crumbling sections, weathered stone.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"Because the fortress is in rough shape. The 1827 earthquake, plus 200 years of weather, plus increased tourism since the cable car opened in 2012—it's all taken a toll. Parts were at risk of collapse."

**VISUAL**: Back to Lilia.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"So they're restoring it. Which is good—we want this place to survive another 1,700 years. But it means access might be limited. Check before you go. The cable car still runs, the views are still there, but the fortress itself might be off-limits."

---

## OUTRO: REFLECTION (11:00-11:45)

**VISUAL**: Back at the top of the fortress, golden hour light starting. Lilia alone in a quiet corner.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA, final thoughts)**:
"So, Narikala. It's not a preserved castle with rooms to explore. It's not a museum with artifacts and plaques. It's ruins. Romantic, ancient, honest ruins. And a viewpoint. An incredible viewpoint."

**VISUAL**: One last panoramic sweep of Tbilisi in beautiful light.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"But that combination—standing in 1,700-year-old walls while looking out over a living, breathing city—that's powerful. You're connecting past and present. Defense and beauty. History and now."

**VISUAL**: Lilia walking toward the cable car station for the ride down, looking back once at the fortress.

**LILIA (TO CAMERA)**:
"Take the cable car up if you want ease and aerial views. Hike the stairs if you want authenticity and Old Town atmosphere. Better yet, do both. Cable car up, stairs down. That's the full Narikala experience."

**VISUAL**: Cable car descending at sunset, fortress walls glowing in golden light above.

**LILIA (VOICEOVER)**:
"And when you're up there, don't rush. Sit for a while. Watch the city. Feel the wind. Touch the ancient stones. Because places like this—they remind you that you're just one more person in a very long line of people who stood here, looking out, wondering what comes next."

**VISUAL**: Final shot—the illuminated fortress at night from across the river, glowing against the dark sky.

- **Slow down in cable car**: Let the aerial views breathe
- **Medium pace for ruins**: Exploration with historical context
- **Linger on panoramas**: These are the payoff, don't rush
- **Dynamic descent**: Stairs should feel like movement and discovery
- **Contemplative ending**: Reflection needs space

### Emotional Beats:
1. **Excitement** (cable car): "This is so cool!"
2. **Curiosity** (arrival): "What am I looking at?"
3. **Appreciation** (ruins): "Honest decay"
4. **Awe** (views): "This is why we're here"

7. **Understanding** (looking back up): "Power architecture"
8. **Connection** (outro): "Long line of people who stood here"

### Thematic Threads:

**Theme 1: Two Journeys, Same Destination**
- Cable car = easy, aerial, futuristic
- Stairs = challenging, intimate, traditional
- Both valid, both valuable, different perspectives

**Theme 2: Ruins vs Restoration**
- Honest decay has its own beauty
- Layers of history visible in crumbling walls
- Not everything needs to be pristine

**Theme 3: Views > Architecture**
- The fortress is the platform for the view
- Location matters more than the structure
- Perspective is the real attraction

**Theme 4: Layers of Time**
- 1,700 years of different rulers, each leaving their mark
- 4th-century foundations, 8th-century Arab walls, modern cable cars
- Past and present coexisting

**Theme 5: Military Purpose, Peaceful Present**
- Built for war, now visited for beauty
- Defensive walls now frame selfies
- Violence transformed into tourism
