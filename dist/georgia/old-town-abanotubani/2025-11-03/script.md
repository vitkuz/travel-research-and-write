**Date**: 2025-11-03

---

## PRE-PRODUCTION NOTES

**Core Message**: Abanotubani isn't what Instagram shows you - it's messy, smelly, crumbling, beautiful, and painfully real. This is where Tbilisi actually began, and you feel it in your bones.

**Emotional Arc**: Skeptical curiosity → Sensory overwhelm → Frustration with fakeness → Discovery of authenticity → Deep connection

**Visual Style**: Raw documentary vlog with handheld energy, cinematic pauses for emotional moments

**Target Audience**: Nomads, slow travelers, people tired of perfect Instagram bullshit

## FULL VOICEOVER SCRIPT

### HOOK (0:00-0:15)

**Visual**: Handheld shot walking through crumbling alleyway with broken cobblestones, faded wooden balconies barely holding on, then sudden cut to Disney-perfect restored street with tourists everywhere

**Audio**:
> "Okay so this is Abanotubani. Old Town Tbilisi. Everyone posts those pretty colored balconies, right? Those perfect little streets? Here's what they don't show you..."

> *[Cut to broken sidewalk, cracked building, child approaching camera]*

> "This. This is also Abanotubani. And honestly? This is the part that's actually real."

**Music**: Start silent, natural street sounds, then subtle ominous undertone building

**Pace**: FAST - immediate contrast, no warm-up

---

### ACT 1: SETUP (0:15-2:00)

**Visual**: Walking toward the bathhouse district from Mirza Shafi Street viewpoint, showing Narikala Fortress looming above, those iconic domed roofs rising from the ground like molehills, morning light hitting the Mtkvari River

**Audio**:
> "I'm standing at the birthplace of Tbilisi. Like, the actual birthplace. Fifth century. King Vakhtang Gorgasali's falcon supposedly chased a pheasant into hot springs right here, and boom - the king founded a whole city. 'Tpilisi' - place of warmth. All because of thermal water."

> "Which sounds romantic as hell until you realize the whole district smells like sulfur. Like eggs. Rotten eggs."

> *[Sniff, make face]*

> "I mean it's not terrible, you get used to it in like two minutes, but that first hit? That first moment you arrive? You're like... am I sure I want to do this?"

**B-Roll**:
- Wide shot of Abanotubani from above showing all the domed bathhouses
- Close-up of steam rising from bathhouse vents
- The statue of the falcon and pheasant locked together
- Orbeliani Baths' blue-tiled facade with tourists clustering
- My face reacting to the sulfur smell

**Music**: Ambient Georgian instrumental, mysterious and ancient-feeling

**Pace**: Medium - setting the scene with personality

---

### BEAT 1.2: Expectations vs Reality (1:15-2:00)

**Visual**: Montage of Instagram-perfect shots (wooden balconies, colorful facades) intercut with what I'm actually seeing (broken pavement, construction barriers, crumbling walls)

**Audio**:
> "So I had expectations, you know? I've seen the photos. Everyone's seen the photos. Those wooden balconies painted in pastels, cobblestone streets looking like a damn movie set. Georgian grandmas selling churchkhela. Very aesthetic. Very... curated."

> "And sure, that exists. Parts of Abanotubani look exactly like that. Restored. Beautiful. Perfect lighting."

> "But then you turn the corner and it's just... chaos. Broken sidewalks. Buildings that look like they're held together by prayer and old paint. Kids asking for money. Construction everywhere. It's like Disney World crashed into a working-class neighborhood and they're just both existing in the same space."

**B-Roll**:
- Perfect Instagram angles
- Then immediate cuts to ramshackle reality
- Laundry hanging from balconies
- Locals going about their day
- Uneven cobblestones, cracks, decay

**Music**: Slight discord, unsettled feeling

**Transition**: "And I'm standing here thinking... which one is real?"

---

### ACT 2: JOURNEY (2:00-7:30)

#### BEAT 2.1: The Streets (2:00-3:15)

**Visual**: Walking slowly through the narrow alleys, camera catching details - peeling paint, wooden balcony details, sun streaming through gaps between buildings, a cat sleeping in a doorway

**Audio**:
> "Okay so let me just wander. That's what you do here. You wander."

> "These streets... they're narrow, twisting, uneven as hell. I'm wearing the wrong shoes, by the way. Pro tip: wear sturdy shoes. These cobblestones will destroy your ankles."

> "But here's the thing. Here's the thing. Every turn reveals something. A hidden courtyard. A tiny café I would've never found. That weird mix of Persian and Byzantine and European architecture all stacked on top of each other like layers of history you can literally touch."

> "I pass this woman hanging laundry from her balcony. Third floor. She lives here. Right here in the middle of tourist central. She's not performing for anyone, she's just... living her life. And tourists are taking photos of her balcony and she doesn't even look down."

> "That's what gets me. People actually live here. This isn't a museum. It's a neighborhood."

**B-Roll**:
- Close-ups of architectural details
- Hands touching old wooden railings
- The woman hanging laundry (shot respectfully from distance)
- Sun and shadow playing on walls
- Traditional Georgian houses, faded pastels
- My feet navigating broken cobblestones

**Music**: Softer, more contemplative

**Pace**: SLOW - let the atmosphere sink in

---

#### BEAT 2.2: The Hidden Waterfall (3:15-4:30)

**Visual**: Finding the entrance to Leghvtakhevi, walking down the narrow ravine path, the waterfall appearing, 22 meters tall cascading into a small pool, almost no one around

**Audio**:
> "So I'm exploring and I see this sign. Leghvtakhevi. Fig Tree Gorge. And I'm like... there's a gorge? Here? In the middle of the Old Town?"

> "I follow this tiny path, down these steps, and suddenly I'm in a completely different world. It's quiet. It's green. There's a waterfall."

> "A waterfall! Twenty-two meters. Just tucked into this ravine like a secret. And there's maybe two other people here. Two. Meanwhile, fifty meters away, there's a mob of tourists at the bathhouses."

> *[Sound of water falling]*

> "This is what I'm talking about. This is what slow travel gives you. Time to find the things that aren't on the Instagram grid. Things that just exist, quietly, waiting for you to pay attention."

> "I sit here for like twenty minutes. Just sit. Just breathe. Just listen to the water."

**B-Roll**:
- Walking down into the gorge
- Wide shot of the full waterfall
- Close-up of water hitting the pool
- Light filtering through trees
- Me sitting on a rock, just still
- Other visitors (shot from behind, respectful)

**Music**: Natural waterfall sounds dominating, minimal music

**Pace**: VERY SLOW - breather moment, let it land

---

#### BEAT 2.3: The Bathhouse Experience (4:30-6:30)

**Visual**: Outside Chreli-Abano (Orbeliani Baths), the blue-tiled Persian-style facade, steam rising from domes, then cut inside (if allowed) or use creative angles to suggest the interior

**Audio**:
> "Alright. The bathhouses. That's why most people come here. That's the whole thing."

> "I booked a private bath. Thirty Lari. Not expensive. I wanted privacy because honestly I had no idea what I was doing and I didn't want to embarrass myself in a public bath."

> "So you go underground. That's the thing about these baths - they're subterranean. Built into the earth. Those brick domes you see popping out of the ground? Those are the roofs. Light comes through these openings in the dome, steam escapes through vents. It's ancient design. Seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth century Persian style."

> "The water is warm. Like really warm. Thirty-eight to forty-five degrees Celsius. Fed by natural thermal springs that have been flowing here for literally fifteen hundred years."

> *[Sound of water, echo of the bath chamber]*

> "And yeah, it smells like sulfur. But you genuinely stop noticing after like five minutes. Your nose just adapts."

> "I opted for the kisa. The traditional scrubbing massage. Which... okay, I wasn't prepared. This guy, he's got these rough mitts, and he's literally scrubbing my skin off. Like scrubbing. I'm talking aggressive exfoliation. Dead skin rolling off in little balls. It's horrifying and amazing at the same time."

> *[Laugh]*

> "I felt like a newborn by the end. Raw. Clean. Like I shed a layer of myself and left it in that bathhouse."

**B-Roll**:
- Exterior of Orbeliani Baths, blue tiles, architectural details
- Steam rising from domes
- Other bathhouses along the street
- If possible: interior shots of the private bath (dim lighting, tile, water, steam)
- Close-up of the gray porous stone flooring
- My face after the bath, glowing, exhausted, transformed

**Music**: Ambient, spa-like but with Georgian character

**Pace**: Medium, with pauses for sensory details

---

#### BEAT 2.4: The Mosque & Multicultural Reality (6:30-7:30)

**Visual**: Walking toward the Botanical Garden path, finding the tucked-away mosque, showing its simple exterior, then pulling back to show proximity to churches

**Audio**:
> "Here's something most people miss. This mosque."

> "It's the only one in Tbilisi that survived Beria's purges in the 1930s. The Soviets demolished religious buildings like it was a sport. But this one, tucked into the hillside on the path to the Botanical Gardens, somehow made it."

> "And it's right here. Right next to churches. Right in the middle of this district that's been home to Muslims, Christians, Armenians, Georgians, Persians, Jews - everyone. For centuries."

> "The demographics shifted over time. Seventeenth century, Iranian expansion meant mostly Muslims lived here. Craftsmen. Dyers. Tailors. Weavers. Working-class people. Then the Soviets came and everything changed. Renovation in the 1970s, displacement, gentrification before that word even meant what it means now."

> "But you can still feel it. That layering. That coexistence. Churches, mosques, synagogues - all within a few blocks. That's Tbilisi. That's Georgia. They've always been a crossroads."

> "And I think about that. How places hold memory. How architecture tells you who belonged here and who was erased."

**B-Roll**:
- The mosque exterior
- Nearby church
- Wide shot showing both in frame
- Narrow streets connecting religious sites
- Locals walking past (everyday life, not performative)

**Music**: Reflective, minor key, contemplative

**Pace**: SLOW - this is heavier, requires space to think

---

### ACT 3: CLIMAX (7:30-9:00)

#### BEAT 3.1: Confronting the Contradictions (7:30-8:30)

**Visual**: Cutting between the perfectly restored tourist streets and the crumbling authentic alleyways, children approaching asking for money, my internal conflict visible

**Audio**:
> "So by now I'm feeling... conflicted. Conflicted as hell."

> "Because parts of Abanotubani are stunning. Restored beautifully. You understand why people come here, why they post about it. It's gorgeous."

> "But then there are these kids. These kids who live in the parts that aren't restored. The parts where buildings are literally falling apart. And they ask tourists for money. And some tourists give them small amounts and the kids look disappointed because it's not enough. And it's uncomfortable. It's really uncomfortable."

> "And I'm thinking... what does preservation mean? Who gets to stay when a place gets renovated? Who gets displaced? Who profits?"

> "The 1970s renovation changed everything. Demographics shifted. Almost all the working-class families who had lived here for generations - the craftsmen, the weavers - they're gone. And now it's us. Tourists. Cafés. AirBnBs probably."

> "I'm part of that. I'm contributing to that by being here. And I don't have an answer. I don't have a solution."

> "All I know is that both versions of Abanotubani are real. The perfect one and the crumbling one. And pretending only one exists is a lie."

**B-Roll**:
- Children in the streets (filmed ethically, from distance)
- Tourists taking perfect photos
- Contrast shots: renovation vs decay
- Me visibly struggling with this, looking at both sides
- Locals in windows watching the scene below

**Music**: Tension, unresolved

**Pace**: Medium to fast, emotional energy building

---

#### BEAT 3.2: PEAK MOMENT - The Gabriadze Puppet Show (8:30-9:00)

**Visual**: The Gabriadze Clock Tower, the puppet theater show "The Circle of Life" at 7pm, the screen opening, mechanical figures performing, my face watching, childlike wonder

**Audio**:
> "It's 7pm. The clock tower - Gabriadze Tower - does this puppet show twice a day. Noon and 7pm. 'The Circle of Life.'"

> "I almost missed it. I was so caught up in my head, in the contradictions, in trying to make sense of everything, that I almost walked right past."

> "But I stop. And the screen opens. And these little mechanical figures come out. Angels. People. Life and death. Birth and renewal. All acted out by puppets in this tiny theater built into a clock tower."

> "And it's... it's absurd. It's whimsical. It's deeply human."

> *[Long pause, just watching]*

> "And I realize that's what this place is. Life and death and birth and decay all happening at once. Old and new. Real and performed. Sacred and profane. It's all here. All layered. All true."

> "You can't separate them. You shouldn't."

**B-Roll**:
- The full puppet show sequence
- Close-up of mechanical figures
- My face watching, tears in my eyes possibly
- Other people watching, shared moment
- The tower at golden hour, light hitting it beautifully

**Music**: Puppet show music (whimsical, haunting), then silence, then soft emotional swell

**Pace**: VERY SLOW - let this moment breathe, this is the payoff

### OUTRO (9:00-9:45)

#### BEAT 4.1: Reflection (9:00-9:30)

**Visual**: Evening in Abanotubani, lights coming on, steam still rising from bathhouses, fortress lit up above, me walking slowly through the quiet streets

**Audio**:
> "Tbilisi started here. Right here. Because a king's falcon chased a bird into hot water. Because someone noticed the warmth and decided to build."

> "And fifteen hundred years later, the water's still flowing. The baths are still here. People are still coming to soak, to scrub away their skin, to be reborn."

> "But so is everything else. The mess. The displacement. The kids asking for money. The gentrification. The performance and the reality."

> "I can't reconcile it. I can't make it neat."

> "What I can do is show up. Pay attention. Spend money at local places, not chains. Talk to people. See the ramshackle alleys and the perfect balconies and acknowledge both. Not curate. Not filter."

> "Abanotubani isn't Instagram. It's real. It's complicated. It's a place where people live and have lived for centuries. And if you come here, you owe it to them to see all of it."

**B-Roll**:
- Evening light, golden hour
- Steam rising, atmospheric
- Locals closing shops, going home
- The fortress glowing against darkening sky
- Me in silhouette, small against the architecture

**Music**: Resolve to calm, hopeful Georgian melody

**Pace**: SLOW - reflective, letting the thoughts settle

---

#### BEAT 4.2: Final Thought & Call to Action (9:30-9:45)

**Visual**: Direct to camera, last light, authentic energy

**Audio**:
> "If you come to Tbilisi, come here. To Abanotubani. Walk the streets. Find the waterfall. Take a bath. Let someone scrub your skin off."

> "But also look at the cracks. The broken parts. The kids. The people living their lives while you take your photos."

> "Because that's the whole story. Not just the pretty part."

> "Trust me on this."

> *[Small smile, tired but genuine]*

> "Alright. I need wine. And khachapuri. I'll see you next time."

**Music**: Fade out to natural street sounds

**End Screen**: Subscribe, previous video, next video thumbnails

## POST-PRODUCTION NOTES

### Color Grading
- Primary: Warm golden tones for evening scenes, cooler desaturated for morning
- Mood: Cinematic but raw - not overly polished
- Key scenes to grade differently: Bathhouse (darker, moodier), waterfall (greener, fresher), puppet show (whimsical, slightly surreal)

### Sound Design
- **Ambient sound**: Heavy use of natural street sounds, water, voices
- **Sound effects**: Waterfall (prominent), steam hissing, footsteps on cobblestones, puppet show mechanism
- **Voice levels**: Narration clear but not studio-perfect - keep some rawness

### Text Overlays
- Minimal: Just key facts when needed (temperatures, dates, historical references)
- Style: Simple white text, subtle
- Avoid over-explaining

### Thumbnail Planning
- **Shot to use**: Me at the crumbling alleyway with perfect restored street visible in background (the contrast shot)
- **Text overlay**: "The REAL Old Town Tbilisi"
- **Expression**: Skeptical but inviting, slightly challenging
