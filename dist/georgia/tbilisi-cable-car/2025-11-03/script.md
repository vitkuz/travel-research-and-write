### Visual
Wide shot of glass cabin suspended above Mtkvari River at sunset, camera inside showing Lilia's face pressed against window

### Audio
[excited] Okay so I'm literally floating over Tbilisi right now. [gasps] Like actually floating. [pause] [whispers] And I have less than three minutes to tell you why this changed everything.

## ACT 1: SETUP - The Reluctant Tourist (0:15-2:00)

### Visual
- Rike Park station exterior, crowds queuing
- Lilia fumbling with Metromoney card at gate
- Close-up of frustration on face
- POV of sleek glass cabins arriving

### Audio
[flatly] So here's the thing. I wasn't gonna do this. [sarcastically] Another tourist attraction. Great. Another glass box floating in the air with forty other people taking the same Instagram photo.

[sighs] I've been in Tbilisi eight months now. Eight months. And locals kept telling me, [mockingly] "Oh Lilia, you have to take the cable car!" [frustrated] And I'm like... I live here. I don't do tourist shit anymore, you know?

But then my friend Nino—she's Georgian, she's lived here her whole life—she looks at me yesterday and goes, [matter-of-fact] "Lilia. Two and a half lari. Just do it." [pause] Two and a half lari. That's like... a dollar. A dollar.

[rushed] So here I am. At Rike Park. It's like 6pm. Golden hour. And immediately I'm annoyed because— [laughs] because I can't pay with cash. Of course I can't. [sarcastically] Cash is so 2010, Lilia. Get with the program.

[nervous] I had to buy this Metromoney card thing at the station. The woman at the counter spoke zero English, I spoke shit Georgian, [giggles] and we just sort of... pointed at things and exchanged money until something worked.

[quietly] And now I'm standing here watching these glass cabins arrive every minute. Every single minute. [pause] They're beautiful, honestly. Sleek. Modern. Italian-made, apparently. [whispers] Very un-Soviet.

### Production Notes
- B-roll: Queue line, card payment machine, cabins arriving, Lilia's annoyed expressions
- Music: Minimal, subtle tension building
- Pacing: Fast-paced to match Lilia's cynical energy

## ACT 2: THE JOURNEY - Ascending Into Wonder (2:00-6:30)

### Beat 1: Boarding & Initial Ascent (2:00-3:30)

#### Visual
- Cabin door opening, Lilia stepping in
- Interior shot showing glass walls, other passengers (family with kids, elderly couple)
- POV as cabin leaves station, ground dropping away
- Close-up of Lilia's face as expression shifts from skeptical to surprised

#### Audio
[matter-of-fact] So the cabin holds eight people. Eight. I'm in here with a Georgian family—two kids who will not stop moving—an elderly couple holding hands, [pause] and some guy with the biggest camera I've ever seen in my life. [laughs] Like, sir, this is a three-minute ride, not National Geographic.

[excited] And then we start moving. [pause] And— [gasps] oh my god.

[whispers] Okay. Okay wait. [stammers] I wasn't... I wasn't ready for this.

[quietly] The cabin just... lifts. Like you feel it in your stomach. That little drop sensation except you're going up. [nervous laugh] And the glass walls, they're not just windows—it's all glass. Floor to ceiling. You can see everything. Everything.

[rushed] To the right, there's the Bridge of Peace—that white futuristic arc thing—and it's glowing in the sunset. To the left, Old Town with all those terracotta roofs and wooden balconies stacked on top of each other like some crazy Tetris game. [pause] And beneath us... [whispers] the Mtkvari River. Just brown and slow and ancient.

[emotionally] And I'm standing here holding this pole in the middle of the cabin, [laughs] trying to act cool, trying to act like I've done this before, but my heart is just— [pause] it's pounding.

One of the kids, this little girl maybe six years old, she presses her face against the glass and goes, [childlike tone] "Deda! Deda! Look!" [pause] [softly] And her mom smiles at me. This knowing smile. Like, [whispers] "Yeah. It gets everyone."

### Beat 2: The Realization (3:30-5:00)

#### Visual
- Wide aerial shots of Tbilisi from cabin POV
- Lilia's hands on glass, leaning forward
- Close-up of passing over Old Town rooftops
- Camera shows how fast landmarks pass by
- Mother of Georgia statue growing larger ahead

#### Audio
[curious] The thing is, [pause] the thing is it's moving at five kilometers per hour. Five. That's like... walking speed. [frustrated] But it feels fast. It feels so fast because you're trying to see everything at once and your brain can't process it all.

[rushed] I'm trying to photograph the Bridge of Peace but then I see Narikala Fortress walls ahead getting bigger and then I look down and there's this courtyard with laundry hanging between buildings and cats sleeping on a balcony and— [laughs] —and I've already missed the Bridge of Peace shot!

[resigned tone] Two minutes. I've been up here two minutes. And I already know [pause] I'm gonna have to do this again.

[quietly] But here's what I didn't expect. [pause] Here's what nobody told me.

[emotionally] It's not about the landmarks. It's not. [whispers] It's about the sensation of leaving the ground.

[softly] I'm a nomad, right? I've lived in thirty countries. Thirty. I'm always moving. Always packing, always unpacking, always searching for the next place. [pause] And somewhere in all that motion, I forgot [hesitates] I forgot what it feels like to just... float.

[sighs] To be suspended between where you were and where you're going. [whispers] To have no control. To just trust the cable, trust the machinery, trust that you'll arrive safely on the other side.

[pause]

[quietly] The old couple holding hands? [emotionally] They're not looking at the view. They're looking at each other. And I realize [whispers] they've probably been riding this thing since it opened in 2012. Twelve years. Maybe this is their ritual. Maybe this is how they remember they're still here, still together, still floating above the city that's changed so much beneath them.

### Beat 3: Crossing Emotional Territory (5:00-6:30)

#### Visual
- Cabin reaching highest point, Tbilisi spread below
- Golden hour light flooding through glass walls
- Lilia wiping eyes subtly
- Caucasus Mountains visible in distance (if clear day)
- Mother of Georgia statue now close, dominating view

#### Audio
[tired] I'm not gonna lie. I got emotional. [laughs] Like, crying in a cable car with strangers emotional. [giggles] Super normal, totally not weird.

[sarcastically] But nobody noticed because Camera Guy is literally hanging out the window—well, not literally, but you know—[laughs] and the kids are screaming and the mom is trying to calm them down, and [pause] [whispers] and I'm just standing here realizing something.

[emotionally] This city. [pause] Tbilisi. [sighs] It broke me and built me back up so many times. The first week I was here, I cried every single day. Every day. I didn't know the language, didn't know anyone, [frustrated] couldn't even read street signs. Those Georgian letters? [laughs] They looked like beautiful alien symbols.

[softly] But I stayed. I stayed because leaving felt harder than staying. [pause] And somewhere between getting lost in Old Town and learning to say [foreign accent] "gamarjoba" without sounding like an idiot, [whispers] this place became mine.

[rushed] And now I'm up here, floating above it all, watching the sun turn the city golden, [emotionally] and I can point to neighborhoods and go "I've walked that street," "I know that bakery," "I cried on that bench by the river."

[pause]

[whispers] You can see the whole city from up here. All of it. [quietly] And it's so small. This place that felt like the entire world when I first arrived—[pause]—it fits in one glance.

[hesitates] But the mountains... [gasps] [whispers] the mountains behind it. The Caucasus Mountains. [pause] They're just sitting there in the distance, snow-capped and ancient and permanent. [emotionally] And I realize: [pause] I'm the glass cabin. Temporary. Passing through. But Tbilisi? [whispers] Tbilisi is the mountains. It was here before me. It'll be here after me.

[sighs]

[flatly] And then the ride ends.

## ACT 3: ARRIVAL & AFTERMATH (6:30-8:30)

### Beat 1: The Sudden Stop (6:30-7:30)

#### Visual
- Cabin docking at upper station
- Lilia stepping out, looking disoriented
- Summit viewpoint with Mother of Georgia statue
- Other passengers dispersing quickly
- Lilia standing still, camera panning around her

#### Audio
[frustrated] Three minutes. [laughs] Three minutes! [sarcastically] That's it. That's the whole ride. You blink and it's over.

[rushed] We dock at the top station and everyone just... leaves. The family runs toward Mother of Georgia statue, Camera Guy is already gone hunting his next shot, the old couple walks slowly toward the viewpoint holding hands, [pause] and I'm just standing here like— [stammers] like wait. Wait, can we talk about what just happened?

[giggles] But nobody's talking about it. It's just a cable car ride to them. [flatly] It's Tuesday evening in Tbilisi. NBD.

[quietly] I walk to the edge of the viewpoint. [pause] And okay, yes, [excited] the view is insane. Absolutely insane. You can see the whole city—Old Town, New Town, the river snaking through, bridges connecting everything, [whispers] and if you squint you can see Rike Park way down below where we started. Like the tiniest green patch.

[emotionally] And I think about that 1990 disaster. [pause] The Soviet-era cable car that crashed. [sadly] Nineteen people died. Nineteen. Most of them kids. [whispers] Children's Day celebration. [pause] They were just... they were just excited kids on a cable car.

[sighs] And nobody talks about it now. This modern system—Italian-designed, perfectly safe, operating every day since 2012—[pause] it sort of... buried that memory. Replaced it with something new. Something that works.

[softly] But older Georgians, like Nino, they remember. [quietly] They remember every time they ride this thing. [pause] Every successful landing is a small victory.

### Beat 2: The Return Decision (7:30-8:30)

#### Visual
- Lilia walking back to upper cable car station
- Queue forming for descent
- Close-up of her purchasing another ride
- Interior cabin shot descending, twilight setting in
- City lights beginning to activate below

#### Audio
[matter-of-fact] So obviously I rode it again. [laughs] Obviously. I bought another ticket immediately.

[excited] Because here's what I figured out: You have to do it twice. [rushed] First time you're overwhelmed, you're trying to see everything, photograph everything, process everything. First time is chaos. [pause] First time is just survival.

[calmly] Second time? [whispers] Second time you know what's coming. You know which side has the best view. You know when to put the camera down and just look. [pause] You know it's only three minutes, [softly] so you pay attention differently.

[giggles] And second time I went down instead of up. [pause] Descending feels completely different. It's like— [hesitates] like returning to earth after floating in space. You watch the city grow larger, details coming back into focus, [whispers] and you land in Rike Park and suddenly you're just... a person again. Walking on solid ground.

[emotionally] But something shifted. [pause] Something in me shifted.

[quietly] I think... [sighs] I think I needed to see Tbilisi from above. From that perspective. [whispers] To remember that the city that feels like my whole world—[pause]—it's actually just one small place. One small, beautiful, temporary place. [pause] And I get to be here. Even if it's just for now.

[softly] Even if I'm just passing through.

## OUTRO: REFLECTION (8:30-10:00)

### Visual
- Lilia walking through Rike Park at twilight
- Cable car cabins still moving overhead, now illuminated
- City lights twinkling in background
- Close-up of Lilia's face, genuine smile, slightly tear-stained
- Final wide shot of cable car against night sky

### Audio
[tired] So. [laughs] The Tbilisi cable car. [pause] Two and a half lari. One dollar. Three minutes.

[sarcastically] Locals were right. Nino was right. [giggles] She's always right, it's annoying.

[emotionally] It's not just a cable car. [pause] It's not. It's a three-minute meditation on impermanence. [whispers] On floating. On trusting something outside yourself to carry you from one place to another.

[softly] And I guess [hesitates] I guess that's what travel is, right? [pause] You leave solid ground. You float for a while. You're suspended between where you were and where you're going. [quietly] And you don't know what's waiting at the other end, but you trust the cable anyway.

[sighs] [laughs] God, I'm so dramatic. [giggles] Crying in a tourist cable car. Making it about my entire nomadic existence. [sarcastically] Very normal, Lilia. Very chill.

[pause]

[quietly] But here's the thing. [emotionally] Here's the thing. [whispers] I needed this. I needed to float above this city that's been my home for eight months and see it as a whole. See all of it at once. [pause] See that I've made a life here. Even a temporary one.

[matter-of-fact] Tips if you're gonna do this: [rushed] Go at sunset. Buy the Metromoney card first—they don't take cash. Ride it twice, up and down. Put your phone away for at least thirty seconds and just look. [pause] Let yourself float.

[softly] Narikala Fortress at the top was closed when I went—it's under rehabilitation or something—but honestly? [whispers] The ride itself is the thing. The fortress is just an excuse.

[emotionally] And if you're a nomad like me, if you're someone who's always moving, always searching, [pause] [quietly] always wondering if you're making the right choice living this way—[whispers]—take the cable car. [pause] Take the cable car and watch your temporary home shrink and grow beneath you. [softly] Watch how small it is. How big it is. How both things can be true at once.

[sighs]

[calmly] I'm still figuring out where I belong. Still looking for that place that feels permanent. [pause] But maybe [hesitates] maybe the point isn't to find it. [whispers] Maybe the point is to float. To trust the cable. To be suspended between where you were and where you're going.

[pause]

[quietly] And to know that even temporary homes [emotionally] can change you forever.

[softly] Tbilisi taught me that.

[pause]

[whispers] Three minutes at a time.
