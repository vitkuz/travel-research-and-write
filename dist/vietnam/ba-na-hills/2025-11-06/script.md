## HOOK (0:00 - 0:15)

[curious] Okay so. [pause] I'm standing in medieval France right now. [laughs] Cobblestone streets, Gothic cathedrals, the whole thing.

[sarcastically] Except... [pause] [quietly] I'm on top of a Vietnamese mountain.

[excited] And it gets weirder. Trust me on this.

---

## ACT 1: THE ASCENT & FIRST IMPRESSIONS (0:15 - 2:30)

### Cable Car Journey (0:15 - 1:15)

[nervous] Here's the thing. To get to this place, you take a cable car. [pause] Not just any cable car.

[reading] "The longest non-stop single track cable car in the world." [laughs] Guinness World Record and everything.

[excited] Five point eight kilometers. [pause] That's like... [stammers] almost four miles straight up into the mountains.

[whispers] And you're just... hanging there. In this glass box.

[gasps] The view though. [pause] Oh my god the view.

[softly] You start at Da Nang—tropical, humid, palm trees everywhere. And then you're rising through jungle, through clouds, [pause] like literally through clouds, and you can see the coastline stretching out behind you.

[laughs] My ears popped. Twice.

[quietly] The temperature dropped like seven degrees. Just on the ride up.

### Arrival (1:15 - 2:30)

[deadpan] So I step out of the cable car. [pause] And I'm in France.

[sarcastically] Or Vietnam's idea of France, I should say.

[excited] But like, okay, it's wild. It's absolutely wild. There's a medieval French village just... sitting here. At fourteen hundred meters elevation. [laughs] In Vietnam.

[curious] Cobblestone streets. Gothic cathedral. Stone houses with shutters. [pause] A fountain in the town square with like, cherubs and everything.

[flatly] There are brides. [pause] So many brides.

[laughs] I counted. I'm standing here and I count twelve brides in wedding dresses taking photos within like, what, fifty meters? [giggles] Twelve!

[sarcastically] And tour groups. And selfie sticks. [sighs] Everywhere.

[whispers] This is not the serene Instagram moment I was expecting. [pause] At all.

---

## ACT 2: EXPLORING THE SURREAL (2:30 - 7:00)

### The Golden Bridge (2:30 - 4:00)

[excited] Okay so the Golden Bridge. [pause] This is what everyone comes here for.

[dramatically] It's this hundred-fifty-meter-long pedestrian bridge, right? And it's held up by [pause] these massive stone hands.

[laughs] Like, giant hands of gods. That's what they're called. "Giant hands of gods cradling a golden thread."

[curious] I mean... [pause] it's stunning. [quietly] I'm not gonna lie, it's actually stunning.

[frustrated] But getting a photo? [laughs] Forget it. Just forget it.

[sarcastically] There are dozens of people—brides, again, so many brides—jostling for position. [flatly] Everyone wants the exact same shot they saw on Instagram.

[giggles] I watched this one bride elbow another bride. [laughs harder] Like actually physically move her out of the frame.

[pause]

[softly] But then... [whispers] the fog rolled in.

[emotionally] And suddenly these stone hands, they just... disappeared into the mist. [pause] Like they were reaching up into heaven or something.

[quietly] And for a moment—just a moment—it felt magical. [pause] Even with all the chaos.

### The French Village Reality (4:00 - 5:30)

[matter-of-fact] So here's what nobody tells you about Ba Na Hills.

[flatly] It's a theme park. [pause] Like, a full-blown theme park.

[sarcastically] Yeah, there was a French colonial resort here in 1919. [pause] With villas and sports fields and restaurants. But that's all gone.

[deadpan] All of it. Except one wine cellar.

[laughs] The rest? [pause] Rebuilt. By Sun Group. Vietnam's biggest hospitality company.

[sarcastically] So this "authentic French village" you're walking through? [pause] It was built in 2013. [giggles] On a former American helicopter landing pad from the Vietnam War.

[pause]

[quietly] But here's the thing though. Here's the thing.

[hesitates] It doesn't... it doesn't actually matter that it's fake.

[softly] Because it's not trying to fool you. [pause] It's not pretending to be real history.

[curious] It's pure fantasy. [pause] Like walking into a storybook. Or a movie set. And once you accept that? [pause] It's kind of... [stammers] kind of amazing?

[laughs] I had coffee. In a Gothic-style café. [giggles] With stone arches and medieval décor. And the coffee was actually good!

[cheerfully] Like genuinely good Vietnamese coffee. At reasonable prices!

### The Four Seasons Phenomenon (5:30 - 6:30)

[excited] Oh! And the weather. [pause] The weather is just bonkers.

[laughs] They call it "four seasons in one day."

[matter-of-fact] Morning? Fourteen degrees Celsius. Foggy. You need a jacket.

[rushed] By noon it's twenty-eight degrees and sunny. You're sweating.

[flatly] Afternoon? Cool again. Evening? Freezing.

[giggles] I watched tourists frantically peeling off layers, putting them back on, peeling them off again. [laughs] Like a weird clothing dance.

[sarcastically] Down in Da Nang it's thirty-five degrees. [pause] Sweltering. Humid. Tropical hell.

[cheerfully] Up here? [pause] Sweater weather. [laughs] In Vietnam!

### Fantasy Park Underground (6:30 - 7:00)

[curious] There's also this massive indoor amusement park. [pause] Underground.

[reading] "Fantasy Park. Vietnam's largest indoor amusement park. Twenty-one thousand square meters."

[laughs] Three levels. All underground. [pause] Inspired by Jules Verne novels.

[sarcastically] You know, "Journey to the Center of the Earth." [giggles] Because why not.

[flatly] I didn't even make it there. [sighs] I was too exhausted from the bridge and the village.

[laughs] But I watched families streaming in with kids. [pause] And I thought... [quietly] this place could swallow your entire day. [pause] Easily.

---

## ACT 3: THE UNEXPECTED MOMENTS (7:00 - 9:00)

### Linh Ung Pagoda (7:00 - 8:00)

[softly] But then I found the pagoda.

[whispers] Linh Ung Pagoda.

[pause]

[emotionally] It sits at the top of Chua Mountain. Fourteen hundred meters up. [pause] And there's this twenty-seven-meter-tall white Buddha.

[quietly] Just sitting there. [pause] Meditating on a lotus flower.

[sighs] And the noise... it all fell away.

[whispers] There were people praying. [pause] Incense smoke curling up through the pine trees. [pause] Chanting echoing softly.

[softly] And it was... [hesitates] it was real. [pause] You know? Like genuinely real.

[emotionally] After all the manufactured spectacle—the fake French village, the Instagram brides, the theme park—this felt... [pause] sacred.

[quietly] I stood there for a long time. [pause] Just breathing.

[whispers] Listening to the wind through the trees. [pause] Watching people bow and pray.

[softly] It reminded me... [pause] [emotionally] places can hold meaning even when they're surrounded by chaos.

### The Debay Wine Cellar (8:00 - 9:00)

[curious] And the wine cellar. [pause] Oh my god the wine cellar.

[excited] This is the only original structure left from 1919. [pause] Built by twelve French guys.

[sarcastically] They carved a hundred-meter tunnel. [pause] By hand. [laughs] Into the mountain.

[cheerfully] It's got twelve storage holes, different sizes for different wines. [pause] A little central bar that fits ten people.

[giggles] Ten people! That's it!

[warmly] And the temperature is perfect year-round. [pause] Natural mountain cooling. [quietly] Engineering from a hundred years ago that still works.

[laughs] I had wine. [pause] I sat in this tiny underground bar, surrounded by stone, and I had wine.

[softly] And it felt... [pause] [emotionally] it felt like touching something real. [pause] Something that survived.

[whispers] Everyone above ground is chasing Instagram photos. [pause] And I'm sitting in a tunnel built during French colonialism, [pause] drinking wine, [pause] thinking about time.

[sighs] It was perfect.

## ACT 4: REFLECTION & REALITY (9:00 - 10:00)

### Expectations vs Reality (9:00 - 9:40)

[matter-of-fact] Okay so. [pause] Here's what I expected.

[flatly] Serene Golden Bridge. Empty. [pause] Perfect photos. Quick visit.

[sarcastically] Maybe some authentic French colonial history. [giggles] Cultural education.

[deadpan] Cool mountain weather all day.

[pause]

[laughs] Yeah. No.

[rushed] Reality? Packed with crowds. Dozens of brides. Tour groups everywhere. [pause] You need a full theme park ticket—nine hundred fifty thousand dong, that's like thirty-nine US dollars—and you're committing to the whole complex for hours.

[flatly] The French village is a modern recreation. [pause] Built on an American military helipad.

[giggles] And the weather swings wildly from freezing fog to tropical heat within hours.

[pause]

[softly] But you know what though?

[quietly] [emotionally] Once I stopped expecting authenticity... [pause] once I accepted it for what it is—a surreal, manufactured, over-the-top fantasy world—

[whispers] I kind of loved it.

### The Real Ba Na Hills (9:40 - 10:00)

[warmly] Ba Na Hills isn't trying to be real. [pause] It's trying to be magic.

[softly] And in this weird, chaotic, completely absurd way... [pause] it works.

[giggles] Yeah, it's crowded. Yeah, it's commercial. [pause] Yeah, you're sharing the Golden Bridge with thirty brides and their photographers.

[laughs] But there are moments. [pause] Quiet moments.

[whispers] Like when fog wraps around those stone hands. [pause] Or when you sit in the century-old wine cellar. [pause] Or when you stand in front of the Buddha and just... breathe.

[emotionally] And the cable car ride? [pause] Emerging through clouds to see this impossible kingdom floating in mist?

[softly] That's... [pause] that's something.

---

## OUTRO (10:00 - 10:30)

[matter-of-fact] So if you're going to Ba Na Hills—and honestly, you probably should—

[cheerfully] Go early. [pause] Like seven-thirty AM early. Before the tour groups swarm.

[laughs] Bring layers. [pause] Trust me. Jacket, t-shirt, everything in between.

[sarcastically] Accept that you will not get pristine Instagram photos. [pause] Make peace with that now.

[warmly] But go to the pagoda. [pause] Go to the wine cellar. [pause] And let the fog surprise you.

[softly] Because Ba Na Hills... [pause] it's not what you expect.

[giggles] It's not authentic. [pause] It's not quiet. [pause] It's not a hidden gem.

[emotionally] But it's unforgettable. [pause] In the weirdest, most Vietnamese way possible.

[warmly] A French fantasy kingdom. [pause] On a Vietnamese mountain. [pause] Built by a theme park company.

[laughs] And somehow... [pause] [whispers] somehow it works.

[cheerfully] See you up there. [pause] [giggles] Bring a sweater.

1. **Cable car ascent** - rising through clouds, coastline views, temperature change visible in condensation
2. **Golden Bridge** - stone hands in clear weather AND in fog, crowds of brides, close-ups of golden railings
3. **French Village** - cobblestone streets, Gothic cathedral, fountain, cafés, architectural details
4. **Wedding chaos** - brides posing, photographers orchestrating shots, the absurd spectacle
5. **Linh Ung Pagoda** - 27m white Buddha, incense smoke, prayer scenes, peaceful contrast
6. **Debay Wine Cellar** - tunnel entrance, stone storage holes, intimate bar, wine tasting
7. **Weather transitions** - fog rolling in, sun breaking through, tourists changing clothes
8. **Fantasy Park entrance** - brief glimpse of underground levels (if accessible)
9. **Quiet moments** - solitary shots away from crowds, pine forests, distant mountain views
10. **Cable car descent** - looking back at the resort from above

### B-Roll Priority:
- Close-ups of hands on railings, feet on cobblestones
- Fog movement in time-lapse
- Details: stone textures, Gothic architecture elements, Buddha's face
- Crowd dynamics: brides, selfie-takers, families
- Temperature indicators: visible breath in morning, sweating tourists midday
- Wine bottles in cellar, incense smoke curling upward

### Audio/Music Cues:
- **0:00-2:30**: Curious, slightly ominous build (cable car ascent)
- **2:30-4:00**: Epic, Instagram-worthy music (Golden Bridge reveal)
- **4:00-5:30**: Playful, slightly sarcastic undertones (reality check)
- **5:30-7:00**: Energetic, whimsical (exploring the park)
- **7:00-8:00**: Peaceful, spiritual (pagoda scene)
- **8:00-9:00**: Intimate, reflective (wine cellar)
- **9:00-10:30**: Warm, conclusive (final reflection)

### Pacing Notes:
- Fast cuts during crowded Golden Bridge section (2:30-4:00)
- Slow, lingering shots at pagoda (7:00-8:00)
- Time-lapse of fog movement
- Quick montage of weather changes (5:30-6:30)
- Hold on Buddha statue for full 5 seconds
- Wine cellar should feel intimate and slow

### Technical Considerations:
- Shoot in 4K for cropping flexibility in crowds
- ND filters essential for bright midday mountain sun
- Bring stabilizer for walking through village
- Capture cable car POV with wide-angle lens
- Audio: record ambient sounds separately (fog ambience, cable car mechanical sounds, prayer chanting, crowd noise)

---

**Target Platforms**: YouTube (primary), Instagram Reels (cut 60-second version focusing on Golden Bridge + expectations vs reality)

**Estimated Final Length**: 10:00 - 10:30

**Tone**: Raw, honest, emotionally expressive, self-aware about the absurdity while finding genuine moments of beauty

**Key Message**: Ba Na Hills is manufactured fantasy, not authentic history—but once you accept that, it's a unique, unforgettable experience with surprising pockets of real magic.
