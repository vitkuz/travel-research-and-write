## HOOK (0:00-0:15)

[excited] Okay so Vietnam has a bridge that breathes fire. [pause] [laughs] Like, an actual fire-breathing dragon bridge. [sarcastically] And everyone told me I had to see it. [flatly] Had to. Like it's this unmissable, incredible thing.

[quietly] Turns out... [pause] it's way weirder than that.

---

## ACT 1: SETUP - THE HYPE (0:15-2:00)

### The Research Phase (0:15-0:45)

[tired] I spent two days in Da Nang before I even went to see this bridge. Two days. Because honestly? [sighs] I was so over "Instagram landmarks." You know what I mean? Like, how many times can you see the world's biggest this, the world's longest that...

But every single person kept bringing it up. [mimicking others] "Have you been to Dragon Bridge? You have to go for the fire show! It's on weekends at 9 PM!"

[sarcastically] Great. A scheduled tourist spectacle. My favorite.

### The Build-Up (0:45-1:30)

[matter-of-fact] Here's what they tell you about this bridge. It's 666 meters long. [pause] Yes, 666, make of that what you will. It weighs 9,000 tons. The dragon's head alone is 194 tons—like 130 cars just... hanging there above traffic. [nervous laugh]

They spent 88 million US dollars on this thing. Four years of construction. American engineers won the design competition against 18 other countries. [flatly] Vietnam was like, "We're building a dragon bridge and it's gonna be iconic."

[excited] And on weekends? It breathes actual fire and sprays water. Real fire. Real water. [pause] [whispers] From inside a working traffic bridge.

I mean... [laughs] how could I not go?

### Getting Ready (1:30-2:00)

[rushed] So it's Friday night. I leave my guesthouse at 8:15 PM because the internet said "arrive early." [giggles] I'm thinking, how early do you really need to be for a bridge?

[pause] [deadpan] Apparently very fucking early.

## ACT 2: ARRIVAL & REALITY CHECK (2:00-5:30)

### First Impression - Daylight (2:00-2:45)

[curious] I'd actually crossed this bridge twice already. Twice. During the day. Didn't even realize it was *the* Dragon Bridge. [laughs harder] In daylight, it just looks like... [searching for words] a golden steel arch?

You know how promotional photos show this magnificent dragon from above, every scale visible, this majestic creature stretching across the river? [sarcastically] Yeah, from ground level it's basically a fancy overpass painted gold.

[honestly] I literally drove over it in a taxi going to My Khe Beach and the driver had to tell me, "That Dragon Bridge." And I was like... [flatly] where? Where's the dragon?

[giggles] It's one of those things that only looks like a dragon from a drone shot. From the street, you gotta use your imagination.

### Approaching the Show (2:45-4:00)

[nervous] So I get to the riverside around 8:20 PM and— [gasps] oh my god, there are already thousands of people. Thousands.

[excited] And here's what surprised me: it's not tourists. I mean, yeah, there are tourists. But it's mostly Vietnamese families. [emphasized] Families. Kids running around, grandparents setting up little plastic stools, people selling drinks from coolers on the sidewalk.

[pause] [softly] It's a weekly ritual. Like... [searching] this is what Da Nang people *do* on Friday nights. They come watch their dragon bridge breathe fire.

I found this tiny café—Bach Dang Street, right along the river—and I got an iced coffee for like... [calculating] 25,000 dong? Two dollars? And suddenly I had a front-row seat. [laughs] While tourists were paying for boat tours and rooftop bars, I'm sitting on a plastic stool with the locals, spending less than my morning coffee back in Tbilisi.

### The LED Pre-Show (4:00-5:30)

[curious] Before 9 PM, before the fire show, the bridge is already putting on this... light spectacle. 15,000 LED lights. [pause] Fifteen thousand. And they just cycle through colors. Rainbow. All the colors. Constantly changing.

[flatly] It's pretty. It's also kind of... random? Like, there's no music, no choreography. Just [mimicking] red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, pink, red again. On repeat.

[giggles] And people are already taking photos. [sarcastically] Because if you don't photograph a rainbow bridge before the fire show, did you even travel?

[pause] [more seriously] But you know what though... [softly] standing there with all these people, watching this thing glow against the black sky, the Han River reflecting all those colors... [whispers] I started to get it.

[emotionally] This isn't about being the most beautiful bridge in the world. It's about community. It's about [searching for words] collective pride. Like, Da Nang built this thing, this ridiculous, over-the-top, fire-breathing dragon thing, and they love it. They actually love it.

## ACT 3: THE FIRE SHOW (5:30-7:00)

### The Moment (5:30-6:15)

[rushed] So around 8:50, traffic stops. Just stops. Six lanes of highway, empty. [pause] And people flood onto the bridge. [excited] Just... flood. Walking where cars were driving two minutes ago.

I stayed on the riverside because [nervous laugh] the internet warned me about the water spray. Apparently people get [emphasized] soaked. Like, drenched. So I positioned myself maybe 100 meters from the dragon's head, left side, where you can see everything but not get destroyed by water.

[pause] [quietly] 9 PM hits.

[excited] And this golden dragon head—this 194-ton steel sculpture hanging over a highway—[pause] shoots actual flames into the night. [gasps] Real fire. Like, you can feel the heat from where I'm standing. You can smell it. That fire smell, that smoke smell, it's [emphasized] real.

[laughs] The crowd goes insane. Cheering, phones up, kids screaming.

Nine fire bursts. [counting] One, two, three... nine. Then water. Three huge sprays that absolutely demolish anyone standing too close. [giggles] I watched people scramble away, completely soaked, laughing their asses off.

### The Letdown (6:15-7:00)

[pause] [honestly] And then... [sighs] it's over.

[flatly] Like, over over. 15 minutes. That's it. Nine fire bursts, three water sprays, done. The bridge lights up again with the rainbow LEDs, traffic starts back up, people start leaving.

[sarcastically] The most hyped attraction in Da Nang. Fifteen minutes.

[tired] And I gotta be honest—I'm not gonna lie—a lot of tourists around me looked... disappointed? Like this was supposed to be this incredible, extended show with choreography and music and multiple acts, and instead it was just [mimicking] fire fire fire, water water water, bye.

I heard someone call it "one of the most overrated tourist attractions in the world." [pause] [quietly] And honestly? I get it. If you came to Da Nang specifically for this, if you planned your whole trip around seeing a dragon breathe fire... [sighs] yeah, you might feel let down.

## ACT 4: THE REAL REVELATION (7:00-8:30)

### What I Actually Saw (7:00-7:45)

[softly] But here's the thing. Here's what I actually saw that night.

[emotionally] I saw a Vietnamese grandmother lifting her grandkid onto her shoulders so he could see better. I saw teenage couples taking selfies, not because it's Instagram-worthy, but because this is their date night spot. I saw old men sitting at sidewalk drink stalls, barely watching the fire anymore because they've seen it a hundred times, just [emphasized] existing there, being part of it.

[pause] [whispers] I saw a city that built something ridiculous and loved it anyway.

The dragon faces the ocean, not the land. [curious] You know why? Because Da Nang wanted to look forward. Wanted to signal ambition, modernity, [searching] outward focus. But they made it a dragon—this ancient Vietnamese symbol of royal power—and gave it a lotus flower tail, representing the peaceful countryside.

[quietly] Strength and peace. Future and tradition. In one absurd, fire-breathing bridge.

### The Workers Inside (7:45-8:30)

[excited] And get this—there's a whole team of people who work *inside* the dragon. [laughs] Like, dragon caretakers. They go inside the steel body, into this hidden interior, and they control the fire and water shows from in there.

[giggles] Can you imagine that job? [mimicking] "What do you do?" "Oh, I make the dragon breathe." [laughs harder] "I'm a dragon technician."

[pause] [softly] But that's what makes it real, you know? It's not automated magic. It's people. Vietnamese workers climbing inside this massive steel creature every Friday, Saturday, Sunday, making sure the dragon performs.

[emotionally] This bridge cost 88 million dollars, took four years to build, weighs 9,000 tons, and it has a team of people whose entire job is to make it come alive. [pause] [whispers] That's commitment. That's love.

## ACT 5: REFLECTION & CLOSING (8:30-9:00)

### Walking Away (8:30-8:50)

[tired] I stayed for another hour after the show. Just walking along the riverside, watching the LED lights cycle through their colors, watching people drift away to Son Tra Night Market a few blocks down.

[honestly] The fire show? [pause] Overrated. Absolutely. If that's all you see, if you come, watch 15 minutes of fire, and leave... [flatly] yeah, you'll be disappointed.

[softly] But if you stay a while. If you sit with the locals, drink cheap coffee, watch families treat this like their weekly tradition... [pause] [emotionally] if you understand that this bridge isn't about impressing tourists, it's about Da Nang showing itself what it can do...

[whispers] Then it's actually kind of beautiful.

### Final Thoughts (8:50-9:00)

[matter-of-fact] Dragon Bridge is a working bridge first, a show second. Six lanes of traffic. Connects the airport to the beach. People commute across it every single day without thinking about it.

[giggles] And then on weekends, for 15 minutes, it becomes a dragon.

[pause] [softly] Maybe that's the most Vietnamese thing about it. Practical and absurd at the same time. Functional and magical. [whispers] Over-the-top and somehow... just right.

[honestly] Would I go out of my way to see it again? [sighs] Probably not. But am I glad I went? [pause] [quietly] Yeah. Yeah, I am.

---

## OUTRO (9:00-9:15)

[conversational] If you go, skip the boat tours and rooftop bars. Find a sidewalk café, get a two-dollar drink, and sit with the locals. [emphasized] That's the real experience.

[pause] [giggles] And maybe... [whispers] stand back from the water spray.

[softly] Trust me on that one.
