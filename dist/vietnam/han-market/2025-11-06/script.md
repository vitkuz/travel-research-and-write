## HOOK (0:00-0:15)

[curious] So everyone told me Han Market is THE place in Da Nang. [pause] Four hundred years old, right? Historic. Authentic. [flatly] The real Vietnam.

[sarcastically] Yeah. About that.

[pause] [quietly] Here's what they don't tell you.

---

## ACT 1: ARRIVAL & FIRST IMPRESSIONS (0:15-2:30)

### BEAT 1: Setting Expectations (0:15-0:45)

[matter-of-fact] Okay, so I'm standing at the Tran Phu entrance. It's 7 AM. I got here early because that's what you're supposed to do, right? [excited] Fresh produce, local shoppers, authentic market vibes.

[laughs] I had this whole image in my head. [dreamy tone] Colonial French architecture, you know? Charming old building from the 1800s. Vendors with conical hats selling produce from baskets.

[pause]

[flatly] That's not what this is.

### BEAT 2: The Reality Check (0:45-1:30)

[honest tone] What I'm looking at is... [hesitates] it's a two-story concrete building. Modern. Fluorescent lights everywhere. It looks like— [laughs] it looks like a mall that's trying really hard to be a traditional market.

[quickly] And here's the thing though, here's the thing. They rebuilt this in 1990. Then renovated it again in 2023. [sarcastically] So yeah, all that historical charm? [pause] Gone. Traded it for efficiency.

[sighs] Twenty-eight thousand square meters. Five hundred seventy-six stalls. [deadpan] They literally organized it by product category. It's color-coded.

[pause] [quietly] I mean, it works. It's just... [hesitates] not what I expected.

### BEAT 3: The Smell Hits (1:30-2:30)

[gasps] Okay but wait. [excited] The ground floor.

[pause]

The smell. [laughs] Oh my god, the smell. It's— [stammers] it's dried squid and fish sauce and this incredible savory grilling pork smell all hitting you at once. [wheezing] Like a punch to the face, but in the best way.

[whispers] That smell? That's real. That's the authentic part everyone's looking for.

I'm weaving through these narrow aisles. [frustrated] And I mean narrow. Like, you're brushing shoulders with every person you pass. [nervous] My backpack keeps hitting things, knocking into produce displays.

[matter-of-fact] The ventilation here is shit. Just shit. It's hot, it's humid, [tired] and it's only 7 AM. By midday? [sarcastically] I can't even imagine.

But the food court... [pause] [whispers] okay, the food court is calling me.

---

## ACT 2: THE DISCOVERY (2:30-6:00)

### BEAT 4: The Food Court Revelation (2:30-3:45)

[excited] So I find this little stall tucked under the staircase area. [giggles] Plastic stools. Tiny tables. This woman, she's got three massive pots of broth going, steam everywhere.

Mi Quang. [pause] Central Vietnamese turmeric noodles.

[matter-of-fact] Thirty thousand dong. That's— [calculating tone] that's like a dollar twenty. For a full bowl. Fresh herbs, shrimp, quail egg, crispy rice crackers on top.

[pause]

[emotionally] I sit down on this tiny plastic stool, and I'm watching her. She's adding each ingredient with such precision, you know? [whispers] Like she's done this ten thousand times. Which she probably has.

[quietly] And it hits me. [pause] This market, yeah it's touristy, yeah it's been modernized to hell and back, but— [hesitates] these vendors? They're still here. Cooking the same recipes. Using the same techniques.

[sighs] The building changed. The vibe changed. [pause] But this? [satisfied tone] This didn't change.

### BEAT 5: The Tourist Tax Reality (3:45-4:45)

[sarcastically] So then I go upstairs. [pause] To shop for souvenirs.

[flatly] Big mistake.

[frustrated] First stall I approach, this middle-aged woman is selling ao dai. You know, the traditional Vietnamese dress? [excited] They're beautiful. Silk ones, chiffon ones, incredible colors.

I ask the price. [pause] [matter-of-fact] She says one million dong.

[laughs] I nearly choked. That's like forty dollars, which honestly isn't terrible for silk, but— [quickly] I know. I know that's inflated. Con Market, which is literally three blocks away? [sarcastically] Same exact thing for thirty percent less.

[resigned tone] So I try to bargain. [pause] [quietly] She won't budge. Won't even look at me. Just waves me away like I'm wasting her time.

[sighs] And this is the thing about Han Market that nobody tells you. [pause] [matter-of-fact] There's this weird superstition. Before 10 AM, vendors believe their first customer determines their whole day's luck. [deadpan] So if they don't like your vibe? They literally won't sell to you.

[laughs] I'm not making this up.

### BEAT 6: The One-Hour Ao Dai Magic (4:45-5:30)

[curious] But then I find this other stall. Different vendor. Younger woman, super friendly.

[excited] And she tells me about this one-hour tailoring service. [pause] [gasps] One hour. They measure you, cut the fabric, sew it, finish it. Sixty minutes.

[laughs] I'm like, that's impossible. [giggles] She just smiles and shows me her sewing machine. Industrial grade. She's clearly done this a thousand times too.

[matter-of-fact] It costs more. Thirty to fifty percent more than the normal twenty-four hour service. But still cheaper than anything I'd get back home.

[pause]

[quietly] I didn't do it. [sighs] I'm constantly moving, you know? Where would I even wear a custom ao dai? [self-deprecating tone] To my next hostel check-in?

[laughs] But I watched her work on someone else's order. [whispers] The precision. The speed. [pause] [amazed tone] It was kind of incredible.

### BEAT 7: The Seafood Surprise (5:30-6:00)

[excited] Okay but the best part. The absolute best part.

Back on the ground floor, there's these fresh seafood stalls. [quickly] And you can pick out live shrimp, crab, squid, whatever. Point at what you want.

[pause]

[whispers] And they cook it for you. Right there. On the spot.

[laughs] I picked out four tiger prawns. The vendor grilled them with garlic and lemongrass. [pause] [emotionally] The smell alone was just— [sighs] insane.

[matter-of-fact] Cost me like three dollars for prawns that would be fifteen dollars at a restaurant.

[giggles] I ate them standing up, right there at the stall, juice dripping down my hands. [pause] [satisfied tone] That was the most authentic moment I had in this whole market.

---

## ACT 3: THE REFLECTION (6:00-8:30)

### BEAT 8: The Contradiction (6:00-7:00)

[thoughtful tone] So here's the thing about Han Market. [pause] It's not what you expect. And honestly? [quietly] That's okay.

[matter-of-fact] Is it touristy? Yeah. Are prices inflated? [flatly] Absolutely. Did they sacrifice historical charm for modern efficiency? [sarcastically] Oh, you bet.

[pause]

[quietly] But it's still functioning. It's still feeding people. [emotionally] Local grandmas are still coming here at 6 AM for fresh vegetables. Vendors are still making Mi Quang the way their mothers taught them.

[hesitates] It's just... [searching for words] it's evolved. [pause] Like everything does.

[sighs] The building from 1657? Gone. The French colonial structure? Rebuilt in the 90s. The charm travelers imagine? [deadpan] Yeah, that's more at Con Market down the street.

[pause]

[quietly] But the flavors? [whispers] The cooking techniques? The muscle memory of vendors who've been here for decades?

[emotionally] That's still here.

### BEAT 9: The Local vs. Tourist Balance (7:00-8:00)

[honest tone] I walked around for another hour. Watched the dynamics.

Ground floor? [matter-of-fact] That's where locals shop. Fresh produce, meat, seafood. Practical stuff. Prices are reasonable if you speak Vietnamese and know what things should cost.

Upper floor? [sarcastically] That's the tourist zone. Fabrics, souvenirs, ao dai, chopsticks, essential oils. [flatly] Every vendor sees a foreigner and multiplies their price by two.

[frustrated] And the thing is, I get it. I do. [pause] Tourism is their income now. Da Nang changed from a quiet coastal city to a massive tourist destination in like fifteen years. [quickly] Of course the markets adapted.

[sighs] But it means you have to work harder to find the authentic moments. [pause] They're there. They're just buried under the tourist-friendly packaging.

[quietly] You have to earn them.

### BEAT 10: What I Learned (8:00-8:30)

[reflective tone] I've been to a lot of markets. [pause] Istanbul's Grand Bazaar. Hanoi's Old Quarter markets. [matter-of-fact] Bangkok's Chatuchak.

They all have this tension. [pause] Between preserving culture and making money. Between authentic and accessible.

[quietly] Han Market chose accessible. [pause] And honestly? For a first-time visitor to Da Nang who only has a few hours and wants to experience Central Vietnamese food and buy some souvenirs?

[matter-of-fact] This works. It's convenient. It's organized. It's safe. [quickly] Like, genuinely safe. No pickpocketing, no aggressive harassment. That's rare for a market this busy.

[pause]

[quietly] But if you want the real thing? [whispers] The messy, chaotic, completely-local experience?

[matter-of-fact] Go to Con Market. Three blocks away. Hung Vuong Street.

[laughs] Same products. Thirty percent cheaper. Way more authentic vibe. [giggles] And the vendors there? They'll actually bargain with you before 10 AM.

---

## OUTRO (8:30-9:00)

[honest tone] So yeah. Han Market. [pause] Four hundred years of history in a building that looks like it's from 1995.

[laughs] It's weird. It's contradictory. [pause] [quietly] It's kind of perfect in its imperfection.

[matter-of-fact] Will I come back? Probably not for shopping. [pause] But for that Mi Quang? For those grilled prawns at 7 AM?

[emotionally] Yeah. [whispers] Absolutely.

[pause]

[playfully] Just don't try to buy anything upstairs before 10 AM. [giggles] Trust me on that.

[matter-of-fact] I'm Lilia. I've been living between countries for nine years now. [quickly] Georgia, Turkey, Vietnam, wherever my suitcase lands.

[quietly] And I'm still learning that authentic doesn't always mean untouched. [pause] Sometimes it means adapted. Evolved. Still alive.

[whispers] Han Market taught me that.

[pause]

[matter-of-fact] Alright. I need more coffee. [laughs] This humidity is killing me.
