## HOOK (0:00-0:15)

**[Visual: Lilia standing at the base, looking up at the karsts, marble dust visible in the air, constant tapping sound in background]**

[sarcastically] Okay so. Marble Mountains. [pause] [flatly] They're not mountains. They're not even marble. [laughs] But here's the thing—

[pause]

[whispers] They were hiding Vietcong soldiers. [excited] Right under the American airbase. Like, literally beneath it.

[curious] And those caves up there? [pause] They're not just caves.

---

## ACT 1: ARRIVAL & EXPECTATIONS (0:15-2:30)

**[Visual: Wide shot of the five karsts rising from rice fields, transition to entrance area with ticket booth, tour groups]**

[tired] I've been in Da Nang for three days, and everyone—everyone—kept telling me about these mountains.

[sarcastically] "Oh, you have to see the Marble Mountains, Lilia." "It's spiritual." "It's ancient."

[flatly] Great. Another spiritual place where tour buses dump fifty people at once.

**[Visual: Lilia at ticket booth, confusion about elevator vs stairs]**

[frustrated] And immediately—immediately—I'm confused at the ticket booth. There's two lines. Two. One for the elevator, one for the stairs.

[laughs] I picked the wrong line. Stood there for ten minutes before I realized.

**[Visual: Close-up of ticket - 40,000 VND, then another sign - Am Phu Cave separate 20,000 VND]**

Forty thousand dong for the main entrance. Which is like... [hesitates] two dollars? Maybe less. But then there's another cave—Am Phu Cave—that costs extra. Twenty thousand more.

[quietly] And I'm thinking, what could be so special they charge separately?

**[Visual: The marble carving village - workshops, dust in air, constant tapping sound]**

[curious] But first, before you even start climbing, there's this whole village at the base. Non Nuoc. And it's just... [pause] marble everywhere.

[excited] Four hundred years of marble carving. Four hundred. These families, they've been doing this since the 1600s.

**[Visual: Artisans working - chiseling, carving Buddhas, marble dust coating everything]**

The sound follows you everywhere. [pause] Tap tap tap tap. Hundreds of workshops. The air is thick with marble dust, you can taste it, and these guys—these artisans—they're just carving massive Buddha statues with hand tools.

[laughs] And you can walk in. Just walk right in. It's free. They don't care. Some of them will even let you try if you ask.

[sarcastically] Which I didn't, because I'd probably destroy a three-hundred-year-old family tradition in five seconds.

---

## ACT 2: THE CLIMB (2:30-4:00)

**[Visual: Beginning of the stone steps, irregular and ancient, humid jungle vegetation on sides]**

[sighs] Okay. So. The stairs.

[frustrated] They tell you there's an elevator. There is. But it only goes to the base level. [flatly] You still have to climb.

One hundred and fifty-six steps. Doesn't sound like much, right?

[tired] Wrong. These steps are... [hesitates] they're not uniform. They were hand-carved centuries ago. Some are tall, some are shallow, they're uneven, they're worn smooth in the middle from millions of feet.

**[Visual: Lilia climbing, sweating, tropical vegetation, glimpses of caves above]**

[breathing heavily] And it's Vietnam. In the middle of the day. Humidity is like ninety percent. I'm sweating through my shirt in the first thirty steps.

[laughs] I passed this Vietnamese grandmother. She must've been seventy. Seventy. And she's just—[giggles]—gliding up these steps like it's nothing. Not even breathing hard. Carrying incense and flowers.

[quietly] Meanwhile I'm dying.

**[Visual: First cave entrance visible, incense smoke, sound shifts to echo]**

[gasps] But then you reach the first cave entrance and—

[pause]

[whispers] The temperature just drops. Like, instantly. Natural air conditioning.

---

## ACT 3: HUYEN KHONG CAVE (4:00-6:00)

**[Visual: Entering Huyen Khong Cave - dim at first, then shafts of light become visible]**

[curious] Huyen Khong Cave. That's the famous one. The one everyone photographs.

[excited] And I get why. I get it.

**[Visual: The collapsed ceiling with five openings - "Buddha's fingers" - light beaming down onto the Buddha statue]**

[whispers] The ceiling is collapsed. There's these five openings—they call them Buddha's fingers—and light just... [pause] pours through.

Like spotlights. Like actual spotlights from thirty meters up, hitting this massive stone Buddha statue against the marble wall.

**[Visual: Close-up of the light beams, dust particles visible in the shafts of light]**

[softly] It's between nine and eleven AM when it's perfect. The angle. The way the sun comes through.

[pause]

[quietly] I stood there for like ten minutes. Just standing. Watching the light move.

**[Visual: Other visitors - some taking photos, but also Vietnamese families praying, leaving offerings]**

But here's what got me. [pause] This isn't a museum.

Fresh incense everywhere. Flowers. Vietnamese families coming in to pray. Like, really pray. [emotionally] Emotional prayers, you know? Not tourist photos. Actual devotion.

**[Visual: Close-up of offerings, joss sticks burning, flower petals]**

[whispers] This is an active worship site. Has been for four hundred years.

**[Visual: Cham Hindu sculptures alongside Buddhist statues]**

[curious] And then you notice the older sculptures. Some are Hindu. From the Champa Kingdom. [pause] Before the Vietnamese Buddhists arrived.

Same cave. Different gods. Centuries apart.

[quietly] They just... coexist. Layer on top of layer of belief.

---

## ACT 4: THE WAR HISTORY (6:00-7:30)

**[Visual: Bullet holes visible in cave walls, close-up of the damaged stone]**

[serious] Okay but here's what they don't advertise in the brochures.

[pause]

During the Vietnam War? [whispers] The Vietcong ran a field hospital inside these caves.

**[Visual: Am Phu Cave entrance sign]**

[flatly] The Americans had the Marble Mountain Air Facility. Right nearby. An entire airbase.

[pause]

[quietly] The enemy was hiding. Literally beneath them.

**[Visual: Darkness of Am Phu Cave, red lighting begins to appear]**

[nervous] So I paid the extra twenty thousand dong for Am Phu Cave. Because I had to know. I had to see what was worth the separate ticket.

[hesitates] And uh. Yeah.

[pause]

It's hell. Buddhist hell.

**[Visual: Red-lit demon sculptures, tortured souls, vivid depictions of the Nine Levels of Hell]**

[quietly] Three hundred and two meters long. The longest cave in Da Nang. And they've recreated the Nine Levels of Hell with sculptures and red lighting and—

[nervous laugh] It's genuinely disturbing. Not cheesy. Not touristy. Like, psychologically heavy.

**[Visual: The steep climb upward through the narrow tunnel - "path to heaven"]**

And then there's this steep tunnel. Narrow. You climb up and up, and it's the path to heaven. From hell to daylight.

[breathing heavily] I'm climbing, and I'm thinking about the soldiers. The Vietcong fighters who hid here. Used these same tunnels.

[whispers] August 23rd, 1968. Special Forces lost sixteen men in a single day near here. Sixteen. In one attack.

[pause]

[quietly] And those ceiling openings in Huyen Khong Cave? The Buddha's fingers? The ones that make the beautiful light?

[flatly] American bombs. The ceiling collapsed from bombing.

[pause]

[softly] What's spiritual now... was violent then.

---

## ACT 5: THE SUMMIT (7:30-9:00)

**[Visual: Reaching the summit viewpoint, 360-degree panorama]**

[exhausted] [sighs] Finally. The top.

**[Visual: Wide panoramic shot - Da Nang city, South China Sea, Non Nuoc Beach, rice fields, the other four mountain peaks]**

[gasps] Oh. Oh wow.

[excited] Okay, this— [pause] This is worth it. This is worth every sweaty step.

**[Visual: Slow pan across the view - urban sprawl meeting coastline]**

You can see everything. The city, the ocean, the beach, the other four mountains. All named after the five elements. Metal, water, wood, fire, earth.

[quietly] Emperor Minh Mang named them in 1825. Ngu Hanh Son. The five element mountains.

**[Visual: Wind blowing, Lilia's hair moving, sense of height and space]**

The wind up here is incredible. Like, strong. And there's this Xa Loi Tower—twenty-eight meters tall—built in 1997. Seven floors. Two hundred statues of Buddha and Bodhisattva.

**[Visual: The tower, close-ups of Buddha statues at different levels]**

[curious] And I'm looking at this tower, and I'm thinking... [pause] This is new. 1997. That's recent.

[quietly] This place hasn't stopped. It's not frozen in history. It's alive. Still growing. Still worshipped.

---

## ACT 6: THE DESCENT & HIDDEN PATHS (9:00-10:30)

**[Visual: Taking the west exit stairs down instead of the main route]**

[matter-of-fact] So. Most tour groups—they go back down the way they came. The main path.

[mischievously] I took the west exit. Because I read somewhere that's where the hidden stuff is.

**[Visual: Smaller caves, quiet meditation spots, fewer people]**

[whispers] And it's true. It's completely different.

Tiny temples. Hidden shrines tucked into alcoves. Side passages that go deep into the rock.

**[Visual: Van Thong Cave - the secret viewpoint accessed through natural tunnel]**

[excited] There's this one cave—Van Thong Cave—where you climb through a natural tunnel, and suddenly you're in this chamber lit from above. Sky light pouring in. Glowing.

[quietly] Nobody else there. Just me and an ancient stele and a Buddha statue.

**[Visual: Tang Chon Cave - stalactites, Cham sculptures, interconnected small caves]**

[curious] And then Tang Chon Cave. Five smaller caves connected. Stalactites. Ancient Cham sculptures alongside Buddhist statues.

It's cool inside. Like, temperature-wise. Naturally air-conditioned. You just want to sit there.

[pause]

[softly] And I did. I just sat. For maybe fifteen minutes. Listening to water drip. Watching how the light hit the rock.

---

## ACT 7: NON NUOC VILLAGE REVISITED (10:30-11:30)

**[Visual: Back at the base, returning to the marble carving village, late afternoon light]**

[tired] [sighs] By the time I'm back down, it's late afternoon.

The workshops are still going. Tap tap tap. That sound never stops.

**[Visual: Close-ups of finished sculptures - massive Buddhas, dragons, phoenixes]**

[curious] I walk into one of the bigger workshops. Just walk in. No one stops me.

There's this artisan—fourth generation—carving a Buddha that's like three meters tall. Three meters. One piece of marble.

[quietly] He doesn't speak English. I don't speak Vietnamese. But he shows me his grandfather's tools. Shows me the technique.

**[Visual: Hand tools - chisels, hammers, the artisan's hands covered in marble dust]**

[emotionally] His hands are completely covered in dust. Scarred from years of work. And he's smiling. Just smiling while he works.

[pause]

[whispers] This craft—this marble carving—it was designated national intangible cultural heritage in 2014.

[quietly] Four hundred years of tradition. Unbroken. Family to family.

**[Visual: The village workshop area at golden hour, marble dust catching the light]**

[softly] The marble dust hangs in the air like fog. And the low sun hits it, and everything glows gold.

[pause]

[whispers] It's beautiful. In this gritty, working, real way.

---

## ACT 8: REFLECTION (11:30-12:00)

**[Visual: Sitting at the base of the mountains, looking up at the karsts in late afternoon light]**

[tired] [sighs] So. The Marble Mountains.

[laughs] They're not marble. They're limestone and marble. And they've been quarried for four hundred years to supply the carving industry.

[flatly] They're not pristine. There's vendors, elevators, modern additions everywhere.

[pause]

[quietly] But they're real. They're layered. Hindu shrines under Buddhist temples. Sacred caves that were war hospitals. Spiritual light created by bomb damage.

**[Visual: Close-up of Lilia, genuine emotion, no performance]**

[emotionally] Here's what I didn't expect. [pause] I didn't expect to feel... [hesitates] heavy.

Not in a bad way. Just... [quietly] there's so much here. So much history compressed into these rocks.

[whispers] Emperors naming mountains. Monks meditating for centuries. Soldiers bleeding in darkness. Families carving stone for four hundred years.

[pause]

[softly] All in the same space. All at once.

**[Visual: The five mountain peaks against the sunset sky]**

[quietly] Metal, water, wood, fire, earth. The five elements.

[pause]

[whispers] Everything that makes the world. Right here.

---

## OUTRO (12:00-12:30)

**[Visual: Final shot - Lilia walking away through the marble village as workshops close for the day]**

[matter-of-fact] If you go—and you should—get there before seven-thirty in the morning. Or after three. Avoid the tour bus crowds.

Buy the Am Phu Cave ticket separately. It's intense, but it matters.

Take the west exit down. The hidden paths are worth it.

**[Visual: Montage - light in Huyen Khong Cave, artisan carving, summit view, children playing near workshops]**

[quietly] And spend time in the village. Non Nuoc. It's free. Watch them work.

[pause]

[softly] These mountains aren't just tourist attractions. They're not just photo ops.

[whispers] They're living. Still worshipped. Still carved. Still revealing layers.

**[Visual: Final wide shot - the five karsts at golden hour, marble dust catching light, sound of tapping chisels fading]**

[pause]

[very quietly] Just like the stone. You have to look deeper.

[pause]

To see what's really there.

- High contrast for Huyen Khong light beams (divine quality)
- Desaturated, eerie for Am Phu Cave (red lights only accent)
- Vibrant, expansive for summit views
- Intimate, shadowy for hidden cave spots

### Music Suggestions
- Opening: Minimal, percussive (match the chisel tapping rhythm)
- Cave exploration: Ambient, reverberant, mysterious
- War history section: Minimal or silence (let gravity speak)
- Summit: Expansive, uplifting, brief release
- Descent/hidden caves: Intimate, contemplative
- Village revisit: Warm, human, traditional Vietnamese instrumentation if possible
- Reflection: Sparse, emotional piano or strings
- Outro: Full circle back to chisel tapping, fade to silence

### Practical Filming Tips
- Must film Huyen Khong Cave between 9:00-11:00 AM for iconic light
- Bring small flashlight/headlamp for darker cave sections
- Use gimbal for climbing sequences (show instability of ancient steps)
- Drone shot restrictions likely - check permissions for aerial establishing shots
- Respect active worship - be discreet filming prayers and offerings
- Non Nuoc village workshops - always ask permission before filming artisans
- Wear modest clothing (shoulders/knees covered) for temple areas
- Closed-toe shoes with good grip essential for safety and authentic climbing footage

### Emotional Beats (for edit pacing)
1. Skepticism (opening) → Use fast cuts, sarcastic energy
2. Physical challenge (climb) → Longer takes, show real effort
3. Beauty revealed (Huyen Khong) → Slow, let light do the work
4. Historical weight (war history) → Silence, minimal cuts, gravity
5. Achievement (summit) → Release, expansive, breathe
6. Discovery (hidden paths) → Intimate, quiet, personal
7. Human connection (village) → Warm, close-ups, real hands
8. Integration (reflection) → Still, contemplative, single take if possible
