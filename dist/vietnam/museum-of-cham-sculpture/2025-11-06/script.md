### AUDIO (Full Voiceover Script with ElevenLabs Tags)

[curious] So here's the thing about museums. [pause] I usually skip them.

[flatly] Tourist traps, overpriced tickets, crowds taking selfies with stuff they don't understand.

[pause] [quietly] But this one? [excited] This one completely destroyed me.

[whispers] And it cost two dollars and fifty cents.

## ACT 1: PRE-ARRIVAL SKEPTICISM (0:15-2:00)

### VISUAL
- B-roll: Da Nang riverfront, modern Dragon Bridge in background
- Walking shots approaching museum
- Exterior architecture shots
- Ticket counter interaction

### AUDIO (Full Voiceover)

[sarcastically] The Museum of Cham Sculpture. [pause] When I saw it on Google Maps I was like, okay, sure.

[tired] Another museum. [sighs] Da Nang is all about beaches and bridges, right? Modern Vietnam, new money, high-rises everywhere.

[hesitates] I mean, I didn't even know who the Cham people were. [laughs] Like, literally had no clue.

[matter-of-fact] Turns out they had an entire kingdom here. [pause] For a thousand years. Fifth century to fifteenth century. Hindu-Buddhist civilization on Vietnam's coast.

[quietly] And then... [pause] they just disappeared.

[curious] So I paid my sixty thousand dong—two fifty USD, like literally nothing—and walked in.

[laughs] No line. No crowds. Just me and these sandstone gods that have been sitting here for over a century.

[whispers] The floor tiles? [pause] Original. From 1919. Still intact. I'm walking on the same tiles French archaeologists walked on when they opened this place.

[excited] That's when I knew something was different here. Something real.

---

## ACT 2: FIRST IMPRESSIONS & CONFUSION (2:00-4:00)

### VISUAL
- Entry into first gallery
- Natural light streaming through large windows
- Wide shots of sculpture arrangements
- Close-ups of carved details
- Lilia studying museum map/audio guide on phone

### AUDIO (Full Voiceover)

[nervous] Okay so. [pause] Walking into that first gallery.

[gasps] Natural light everywhere. These huge windows, and the light just hits these sculptures in this... [emotionally] god, I don't even know how to describe it.

[whispers] It's not like a modern museum with perfect climate control and spotlights. [pause] It's warm. Some galleries are actually kind of stuffy.

[laughs] But that's the point, you know? [curious] It feels authentic. Like you're discovering these pieces the way archaeologists did.

[matter-of-fact] The museum's organized into twelve geographical galleries. Tra Kieu, My Son, Dong Duong, Thap Mam. [hesitates] All these excavation sites across central Vietnam.

[frustrated] And here's the thing—here's the thing. [pause] The English labels? [flatly] Minimal. Like, really minimal.

[sighs] I'm standing in front of these massive sandstone altars and I'm just like... [stammers] what am I even looking at?

[excited] But then! [giggles] Free audio guide. You just go to chamaudio dot com on your phone, scan QR codes next to sculptures.

[cheerfully] And suddenly everything clicks. [pause] Every piece has a story, a history, a context.

[whispers] That Tra Kieu Pedestal? [pause] It's not just carved stone. [emotionally] It's Krishna's life story. Seventh century.

[quietly] The sculptors knew the Hindu epics. They carved scenes from Indian mythology over a thousand years ago, on the other side of the world from India.

[pause] [curious] How? How did they know this stuff in such detail?

---

## ACT 3: THE NATIONAL TREASURES (4:00-6:30)

### VISUAL
- Slow pan across the Tara Bodhisattva statue
- Close-up: Gemstones in eyes and forehead
- Detail shots: Bronze casting texture
- My Son E1 altar from multiple angles
- Dong Duong Buddha with unique hand posture
- Lighting changes as day progresses through windows

### AUDIO (Full Voiceover)

[softly] Nine national treasures of Vietnam are in this museum. [pause] Nine.

[whispers] And you can just... walk up to them. [pause] No glass barriers on most of them. No ropes.

[excited] The Tara Bodhisattva statue. [gasps] Farmers found it. 1978. Plowing a field.

[laughs] Just casually uncovered a 1.15-meter bronze sculpture that had been buried for centuries.

[curious] Look at her. [pause] Gemstones still embedded in the eyes. In the forehead.

[emotionally] The largest bronze Cham sculpture ever found. [whispers] And she was just... underground. Waiting.

[pause]

[matter-of-fact] The My Son E1 altar. Seventh, eighth century. Used to sit in the central temple of the Champa capital.

[quietly] Can you imagine? [pause] Kings prayed at this altar. Made offerings. Asked the gods for protection, for victory, for rain.

[whispers] And now it's here. In this quiet museum in Da Nang. And I'm standing right in front of it.

[sighs]

[curious] The Dong Duong Buddha. [pause] There's this hand posture—this mudra—that you only see in Chinese Buddhist art and right here.

[excited] Like literally nowhere else in Southeast Asia. [pause] Which means ninth-century Champa had direct maritime trade with China.

[giggles] These sculptors were plugged into an entire ocean-wide network of ideas, religions, trade routes.

[whispers] And we barely remember they existed.

---

## ACT 4: REALIZATIONS & DETAILS (6:30-8:00)

### VISUAL
- Secular reliefs: Polo players, daily life scenes
- Hindu deities: Shiva, Ganesha, Garuda
- Buddhist figures: Bodhisattvas, celestial dancers
- Apsaras and temple guardian close-ups
- Original architectural elements preserved in building

### AUDIO (Full Voiceover)

[cheerfully] But here's what really got me. [pause] It's not all gods and religious stuff.

[excited] There are sandstone carvings of polo players. [laughs] Polo! On horses!

[giggles] These ancient Cham aristocrats were playing sports imported from India, and their sculptors were like, "yeah, we're carving this for eternity."

[sarcastically] Priorities, you know? [laughs]

[pause]

[softly] Walking through these galleries, it hits you. [pause] This civilization was sophisticated. Like, really sophisticated.

[matter-of-fact] They mastered lost-wax bronze casting techniques that scholars still don't fully understand.

[curious] They built brick temples with a bonding technique that's never been replicated. [pause] Structures that survived a thousand years of monsoons and wars.

[whispers] Even survived American bombing during the Vietnam War.

[emotionally] And during that war? [pause] Museum staff and locals risked their lives protecting these sculptures.

[quietly] Hid them. Moved them. Made sure they survived.

[pause]

[sighs] Some sculptures still have traces of the original paint. Gold leaf. Gemstones.

[whispers] These weren't neutral gray stone pieces. [pause] They were vibrant. Colorful. Alive.

[excited] And when you look close—like really close—you can still see hints of that. [pause] Little flecks of gold. Spots where inlays used to be.

[softly] Ghosts of what they once were.

---

## ACT 5: THE UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTHS (8:00-9:00)

### VISUAL
- Wide shot: Empty gallery, emphasizing solitude
- View from museum windows: Modern Da Nang, Dragon Bridge
- Historical photographs on walls
- Sanskrit inscriptions that remain untranslated

### AUDIO (Full Voiceover)

[flatly] Here's what nobody talks about though. [pause] The Champa Kingdom fell. 1471.

[matter-of-fact] Vietnamese expansion. The kingdom got absorbed, piece by piece.

[quietly] By 1832, Champa was completely gone. [pause] Erased from the map.

[emotionally] The Cham people still exist—there are Cham communities in Vietnam and Cambodia today. [pause] But the kingdom? The civilization that built all this?

[whispers] Lost.

[sighs]

[curious] And there's Sanskrit inscriptions in this museum that have never been fully translated. [pause] Never.

[frustrated] Locked information about kings, religious practices, diplomatic relationships. [pause] Just sitting there. Undeciphered.

[quietly] Stories we'll never hear. [pause] Voices we'll never understand.

[pause]

[sarcastically] And the museum's on Bach Dang Street. [laughs] You know what happened at Bach Dang River?

[matter-of-fact] 1288. Vietnamese forces defeated Mongol invaders.

[flatly] So the museum celebrating Cham civilization sits on a street commemorating Vietnamese military victory.

[whispers] The irony is just... [sighs] it's heavy.

---

## ACT 6: THE TRANSFORMATION (9:00-10:00)

### VISUAL
- Lilia sitting on bench in museum courtyard
- Garden with flowers, strict signage rules
- Afternoon light through windows at different angle than morning
- Slow pan across sculptures revisited with new understanding
- Close-up: Weathered stone face from opening, now with context

### AUDIO (Full Voiceover)

[tired] I spent three hours in there. [pause] Three hours.

[laughs] I never spend three hours in museums. Like, literally never.

[quietly] But this place... [pause] [emotionally] it changed something in me.

[whispers] Because here's what I realized. [pause] Travel isn't just about seeing new places.

[softly] It's about discovering entire civilizations you never knew existed. [pause] Whole worlds that rose and fell while Europe was still in the Dark Ages.

[emotionally] A thousand years of art, religion, trade, culture. [pause] Gone.

[whispers] And if this museum didn't exist? [pause] We'd barely remember any of it.

[sighs]

[cheerfully] The museum garden is beautiful, by the way. [giggles] Very strict rules though. No picking flowers. No climbing trees.

[sarcastically] I love how serious they are about protecting the garden. [laughs] Like, you can get inches from priceless national treasures inside, but god forbid you touch a flower outside.

[pause]

[softly] I sat there for like twenty minutes. [pause] Just processing.

[quietly] Two dollars and fifty cents. [pause] That's what it cost to have my entire understanding of Southeast Asian history rewritten.

[whispers] Best two fifty I ever spent.

## OUTRO: REFLECTION & CALL TO ACTION (10:00-10:30)

### VISUAL
- Walking out of museum at different time of day (afternoon light)
- Looking back at building exterior
- Han River view
- Final shot: Lilia on riverfront with museum visible in background

### AUDIO (Full Voiceover)

[matter-of-fact] If you're in Da Nang? [pause] Go to this museum.

[excited] Skip the Instagram bridge photos for an hour. [pause] I promise you, this matters more.

[softly] Seventy kilometers away is My Son Sanctuary. [pause] The original temple ruins where these sculptures came from.

[curious] Go there too. [pause] See the temples, then come back and see the art. [emotionally] It'll destroy you. In the best way.

[whispers] You'll understand why archaeologists dedicated their entire lives to preserving this stuff.

[pause]

[cheerfully] Open 7 AM to 5 PM. Sixty thousand dong. Free audio guide. [giggles] Basically free.

[sarcastically] Two hundred thousand people visit every year. [pause] [flatly] Compare that to the millions hitting the beaches and the Dragon Bridge.

[quietly] Most people in Da Nang have no idea what they're missing. [pause] Don't be most people.

[pause]

[emotionally] Because here's the thing. [pause] These sculptures? [whispers] They survived wars, colonization, neglect, time.

[softly] They're still here. [pause] Waiting.

[pause]

[whispers] Go meet them.
