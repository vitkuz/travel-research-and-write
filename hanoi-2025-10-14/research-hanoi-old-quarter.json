  "vibe": "Chaotic yet captivating, the Old Quarter overwhelms first-time visitors with its endless stream of motorbikes, hole-in-the-wall market stalls, and cramped footpaths. Yet beneath the frenetic energy lies authentic Vietnamese culture - the clinking glasses at Beer Street, the hum of happy chatter, and centuries of craftsmanship. It's where Hanoi's soul truly lives, offering an unfiltered glimpse into daily life where tradition meets modernity in beautiful chaos."
