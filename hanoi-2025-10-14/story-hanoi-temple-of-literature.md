# Where Wisdom Dwells: Temple of Literature

The brick walls part, and 1,000 years falls away. You've entered Van Mieu, where Vietnam's first scholars walked these same courtyards seeking enlightenment under Confucius's guidance.

Through the first gate, your footsteps echo on ancient stone. The second courtyard opens to reveal Khue Van Pavilion, its wooden geometry so perfect it graces every 100,000-dong note. Wisdom, the pavilion whispers, is Vietnam's greatest treasure.

Then you see them - 82 stone turtles bearing stelae on their backs. Each carved tablet honors doctoral graduates from 1442 onward, names weathered but undimmed by centuries. You run your fingers along the cool stone, touching the same surface these scholars touched after years of rigorous study.

The Well of Heavenly Clarity reflects clouds drifting overhead, its surface a mirror between earth and sky. In Thai Hoc House, master teacher Chu Van An's statue presides over the space where knowledge once transformed peasants into mandarins.

Outside, the city roars with motorbikes and modernity. But here, behind these walls, education remains sacred. Vietnam's devotion to learning, unbroken for a millennium, lives eternal in these tranquil courtyards.
