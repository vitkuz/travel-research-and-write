# Dancing on Water: Thang Long Water Puppet Theatre

The lights dim, and water ripples silver in the spotlight. You lean forward in your seat as musicians settle into position - erhu, flute, zither, their instruments aged and knowing. Then, impossibly, a wooden dragon rises from the depths, water cascading off painted scales.

This is magic older than memory, an art born in the Red River Delta when farmers first discovered that flooded rice paddies made perfect stages. Behind a bamboo screen, puppeteers stand waist-deep in water, manipulating wooden figures with hidden rods and strings. Their skill, passed down through generations, transforms carved wood into living myth.

A fisherman casts his net. Fish leap and splash, drawing laughter from children in the audience. Suddenly, a phoenix takes flight, fireworks explode in miniature, and smoke swirls across the water's surface. The boundary between puppet and living creature blurs entirely.

Traditional cheo singing rises, haunting and ancient, telling tales of Vietnamese heroes and rice harvests, of love found and battles won. The water catches the light, transforming into liquid stage magic.

When the final dragon descends beneath the surface and the curtain closes, you realize you've witnessed something increasingly rare - an art form that refuses to die, dancing on water just as it has for 900 years.
