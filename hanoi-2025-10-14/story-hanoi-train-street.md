# On the Edge: Train Street

You settle onto a plastic stool, your knees nearly touching the rusted railway track. A Vietnamese coffee steams in your hand, bitter and sweet. Above you, laundry flutters on lines strung between buildings that lean so close they almost kiss. This is Train Street, where life and danger share the same narrow corridor.

The café owner glances at his watch, then at you, grinning. "Five minutes," he says, and begins pulling in flower pots from the tracks.

A whistle sounds in the distance. Your heart kicks up. The ground begins to vibrate under your feet. Suddenly everyone is moving - motorcycles wheeled aside, tables pulled back, bodies pressed against doorways. You stand behind the yellow safety line, but it feels impossibly, thrillingly close.

Then it comes. The train thunders past, metal screaming on metal, wind whipping your hair, so close you could touch death if you were foolish enough to try. It takes fifteen eternal seconds.

Silence rushes back. Tables return to the tracks. The coffee seller laughs at your wide eyes. Life resumes where the train just was, as if nothing extraordinary happened. But your hands are shaking, and you've never felt more alive.
