## 🎬 Voiceover Script

### 1. The Search (0:00-0:45)

Okay so Train Street. I've seen it all over Instagram, TikTok, everywhere. Those viral videos of trains passing inches from cafés. And I wanted to see if it was real or just... I don't know, camera tricks?

Here's the thing though. Finding it is a mission. The government's been trying to shut it down for years—safety reasons, which, fair—so the main entrances near the Old Quarter are sometimes blocked. Guarded by police.

But I asked this woman at my hostel and she's like, "Oh just go to Le Duan section. Still open. Or wait for a café owner to walk you in."

So I'm wandering these tiny alleys, getting directions from locals who just gesture vaguely, and suddenly... there it is.

An actual street. With actual train tracks. Running through the CENTER of people's homes.

And I'm standing there thinking, this is insane. This is just insane.

**Scene Notes:** Wandering through alleys, asking directions. First glimpse of train tracks running between buildings. Immediate reaction of disbelief.

### 2. Life on the Tracks (0:45-1:45)

But here's what the viral videos don't show you. Between trains? This is a functioning NEIGHBORHOOD.

There's laundry hanging directly over the tracks. Kids doing homework on plastic stools placed ON the tracks. A grandmother cooking soup. Her pot is literally two feet from the rail. Motorbikes parked in the tiny gap between track and building wall.

And cafés. So many cafés. Tiny tables and chairs set up right on the railway. ChuChu Railways. Coffee Chill 96. Hanoi 1990s. All with names that lean into the chaos.

I sit down at one. Order Vietnamese coffee. The owner doesn't speak English but she gestures—sit, wait, train coming soon.

And I'm sitting there, sipping coffee, watching this woman fold laundry ten feet away. Watching her kid practice math problems. And I'm thinking... how is this normal? How have they normalized living on active train tracks?

But clearly they have. Because everyone's just... living. Like the train is no big deal. Like this is the most normal street in Hanoi.

**Scene Notes:** Life between trains—laundry, homework, cooking, motorbikes. Close-ups of daily life happening on tracks. Café tables set up. Coffee being served. The surreal normalcy.

### 3. The Train (1:45-2:35)

And then. AND THEN. The horn.

Everyone moves. Not panicking—they've done this thousands of times—but moving with purpose. Café owner starts pulling in tables, chairs. The grandmother grabs her soup pot. The kid picks up his homework. Motorbikes get tucked against walls.

In like 90 seconds, the entire street transforms. Everything that was ON the tracks is now pressed against buildings. People standing in doorways. And the space between the buildings and the tracks? Maybe two feet. MAYBE.

The horn gets louder. I can feel it in my chest.

And then the train comes.

It's massive. Moving slow but steady. The wind from it hits you. The sound is deafening. And it passes SO CLOSE. Like if you reached out, you could touch it. You could absolutely touch it.

I'm pressed against a wall, heart pounding, and the train is RIGHT THERE, and locals are just... watching calmly. Some are on their phones. One guy is literally YAWNING.

The train passes in maybe 60 seconds. And the second it's gone? Instant reset. Tables back out. Chairs repositioned. Coffee brewing. Kid back to homework. Like nothing happened.

**Scene Notes:** Building tension—horn sound, people moving. Train approaching POV. CLOSE shots of train passing, wind effect, overwhelming presence. Immediate reset after—timelapse of furniture going back.

### 4. The Contradiction (2:35-3:15)

Okay so here's where my brain broke a little bit.

The government has tried to shut this down. Multiple times. For OBVIOUS safety reasons. This is an active railway. Trains pass 2-4 times a day. One mistake, one distracted tourist, and it's a tragedy.

But the café owners? The families who live here? This is their income. Their livelihood. These tiny cafés survive on tourists coming to experience the insanity of drinking coffee on train tracks.

So there's this constant tension. Police show up, block entrances. Cafés close for a week, maybe a month. Then quietly reopen. Tourists find new ways in. Locals keep living their lives.

Because what's the alternative? Relocate entire families? Destroy these businesses?

It's messy. It's probably dangerous. And I'm torn, honestly. Part of me thinks, yeah, this should probably be shut down. Safety first.

But part of me—the part that just watched a grandmother cook soup and a kid do math homework and café owners serve coffee on literal train tracks with such practiced calm—that part thinks... who am I to judge how people adapt to survive?

Vietnam has been adapting to impossible circumstances for centuries. This is just another version of that.

**Scene Notes:** Café owners at work. Families in doorways of their homes. The obvious danger vs the obvious necessity. Police barriers (B-roll). The contradiction visualized.

### 5. The Resilience (3:15-3:50)

You know what though? I think Train Street isn't famous because of the train. Not really.

It's famous because it's the most VISIBLE example of something Vietnam does everywhere. Finding ways to live, to thrive, in impossible spaces.

The train forces everyone to cooperate. Everyone has to clear the tracks together. Everyone has to trust the train schedule, trust each other, trust the café owners who've been timing this for years.

It's community born from necessity. It's resilience you can photograph.

And yeah, maybe it won't survive. Maybe the government will permanently shut it down. Maybe safety will win over tourism and tradition.

But while it exists? Train Street is the most Vietnamese thing I've experienced in Hanoi. Because it says: We've survived wars, invasions, colonization, poverty. You think we can't figure out how to drink coffee between train schedules?

I mean, come on.

I left Train Street, coffee still warm in my cup, and I couldn't stop thinking. About resilience. About adaptation. About how humans create community in the most impossible circumstances.

And about how the best stories aren't the ones that make sense. They're the ones that shouldn't exist but do anyway.

Trust me on this.

**Scene Notes:** Final shots of Train Street between trains—full of life. Aerial shot showing how narrow the space is. Locals and tourists together. Ending on cafe owner smiling, train schedule written on board behind her.
