# Island of Tears: Where Mothers Wait Forever

The footbridge from Trinity Suburb leads to a small island in the Svislach River, and you know before arriving that grief lives here. The Island of Tears honors 771 Belarusian sons who never returned from Afghanistan, and the chapel at its center speaks the language of loss.

Four entrances, four altars - each carved with names that were once boys with mothers. You circle the tiny church, surrounded by towering statues of women frozen in eternal anguish. Some hold lamps, still hoping their sons will find their way home. Others stand behind them, petrified by grief that turned flesh to stone.

The weeping angel breaks you. He failed his sacred mission - couldn't shield those 771 soldiers from bullets and bombs and the randomness of war. His granite tears never stop falling.

Boulders bear the names of Afghan provinces where Soviet troops fought: Kandahar, Helmand, Kabul. On one stone, the Mother of God watches over this small island sanctuary. Local families lay flowers at their sons' names, touching the carved letters like they could somehow reach through stone and time.

You leave quietly, across the bridge to life continuing. Behind you, the mothers still wait.
