  "description": "Abanotubani is the historic sulfur bath district in the heart of Old Tbilisi, where the Georgian capital was born over 1,500 years ago. Named after the geothermal springs discovered by King Vakhtang Gorgasali in the 5th century, this enchanting neighborhood features distinctive brick-domed bathhouses that rise from the earth like ancient molehills. The district's name translates to 'bath district' (abano means bathhouse, ubani means district), and Tbilisi itself means 'warm place' - both named after the therapeutic hot springs that flow beneath the cobblestone streets at temperatures of 38-40°C (100-104°F).",
