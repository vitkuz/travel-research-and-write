  "type": "cultural",
  "description": "The Holy Trinity Cathedral, known as Sameba, is the main cathedral of the Georgian Orthodox Church and an iconic symbol of Tbilisi's skyline. Standing majestically on Elia Hill above the Kura River, this architectural marvel was constructed between 1995 and 2004 to commemorate 1,500 years of autocephaly of the Georgian Orthodox Church and 2,000 years from the birth of Jesus. As the third-tallest Eastern Orthodox cathedral in the world, reaching 87.1 meters high with its distinctive golden dome crowned by a 7.5-meter gilded cross, Sameba represents Georgia's post-Soviet national and spiritual revival. The cathedral seamlessly blends traditional Georgian and Byzantine architectural styles, featuring a cruciform layout adorned with elegant arches, intricate mosaics, and beautiful frescoes that showcase the country's enduring faith and cultural identity.",
