# Abanotubani: Where Steam Rises from Ancient Earth

You descend the narrow cobblestone streets of Old Tbilisi, and suddenly the air changes. A sulfurous mist rises from brick domes that emerge from the earth like ancient molehills, each one breathing warmth into the Georgian sky. This is Abanotubani, where King Vakhtang Gorgasali discovered healing springs 1,500 years ago when his falcon plunged into bubbling water while hunting.

You step into the Orbeliani Baths, its facade a stunning mosaic of blue Persian tiles that shimmer in the steam. Inside, 40-degree waters embrace your skin with the same therapeutic touch that soothed Alexandre Dumas in 1858, Pushkin before him, and Marco Polo centuries earlier. A massage therapist approaches with a coarse kisi mitt, scrubbing away layers until you feel reborn. Through the domed ceiling, light streams down as sulfurous vapors swirl upward, creating an otherworldly atmosphere where past and present merge in healing warmth.

This is not just a bath. It is a 1,500-year-old ritual of connection, wellness, and Georgian hospitality.

**Come here to experience what healing felt like before the modern world forgot how to pause.**
