# Georgian National Museum

You step into the cool marble halls, and time collapses around you. In glass cases before you, 3,000-year-old Colchian gold catches the light—intricate spirals and animal forms that once adorned warriors and queens. You lean closer, mesmerized by craftsmanship that predates classical Greece.

Upstairs, you stand face-to-face with humanity's oldest travelers: the Dmanisi skulls, 1.8 million years old, the first human remains ever discovered outside Africa. Your ancestors walked this very ground, hunting beneath the Caucasus peaks.

You wander through galleries where ancient wine vessels from 6,000 BC remind you that Georgians have been celebrating with wine longer than almost anyone. Then you encounter Niko Pirosmanashvili's haunting canvases—146 of them—capturing a Georgia of feast tables and solitary figures, joy and melancholy intertwined.

The final rooms grow darker. The Museum of Soviet Occupation confronts you with photographs, documents, and testimonies from 70 years of repression. Here, gold gives way to iron, and you understand: survival itself is Georgia's greatest artifact.

Visit to witness how a small nation has endured, celebrated, and remembered across millennia.
