# Mother of Georgia (Kartlis Deda)

You step off the cable car at the summit of Sololaki Hill, and there she stands - twenty meters of gleaming aluminum rising against the sky. The Mother of Georgia watches over Tbilisi with an expression both tender and fierce, her traditional dress flowing in sculptural folds that catch the sunlight.

In her left hand, she extends a bowl of wine toward you, a gesture of legendary Georgian hospitality. In her right, a sword points skyward - a reminder that warmth has its limits. This is the Georgian soul made manifest: friends are embraced with unmatched generosity, but enemies face unwavering strength.

Below her feet, the ancient Narikala Fortress crumbles gracefully, and beyond it, the city spreads like a living map - red rooftops cascading down hillsides, the Mtkvari River threading through neighborhoods old and new. The statue has stood here since 1958, though her aluminum form is newer, replacing the original wooden sculpture that commemorated Tbilisi's 1500th birthday.

The wind carries the scent of sulfur from the baths below, mingling with pine from the hillside.

Come here to feel the protective embrace of a nation that knows both celebration and survival.
