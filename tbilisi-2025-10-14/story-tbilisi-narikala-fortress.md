# Narikala Fortress: Standing Guard Over Tbilisi

You ascend through the glass-floored cable car, Tbilisi shrinking beneath your feet as ancient stone walls loom closer. Sixteen centuries of history rise from the hilltop—the Mother Fortress, they call it—where Persian sentries once watched the same Mtkvari River that now glints below.

Your fingers trace weathered stones that have witnessed empires rise and fall: Persian, Byzantine, Arab, Mongol, Georgian. The fortress walls curve along the hillside's natural contours, a defensive embrace that has protected this city since the 4th century.

Inside St. Nicholas Church, vibrant frescoes tell stories in gold and crimson—biblical scenes intertwined with Georgian history, painted on walls rebuilt from ruins. The cool interior offers respite before you climb higher.

At the summit, wind carries the distant hum of the city. The Mother of Georgia statue towers beside you, sword raised toward enemies, wine cup extended toward friends—the Georgian soul crystallized in bronze. Tbilisi sprawls in all directions, ancient and modern breathing together.

This is why you come: to stand where civilizations stood, to see a city through the eyes of its eternal guardian.
