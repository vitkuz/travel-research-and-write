  "unique_facts": [
    "The bridge got its name in the 1940s after the Mtkvari River branch beneath it was redirected - it literally became a 'dry bridge' over a street instead of water",
    "The bridge itself was built between 1847 and 1851, and the river branch was drained in 1933 to protect Old Tbilisi from chronic flooding",
    "The market emerged out of desperation during Perestroika and early independence years when locals sold their personal possessions to make ends meet",
    "It's been one of Tbilisi's most beloved attractions since the 1950s when locals first began bringing their old items to sell",
    "Known as 'the market of memories' because many early vendors were selling their own personal goods and family heirlooms",
    "The market has a fascinating dual personality: Soviet nostalgia on one side, contemporary Georgian handicrafts on the other",
    "Russian is actually spoken more than Georgian at the market, especially among older vendors who grew up during Soviet times",
    "Located just a few hundred meters from Freedom Square, connecting Dedaena Park with Saarbrücken Square"
  ],
  "surprises": [

    "Finding World War II medals, Soviet ID books, and personal photographs being sold - items with real historical weight and personal stories",
    "The non-commercial atmosphere despite being a market - vendors are friendly and conversational rather than pushy",
    "How the market serves as both a historical archive and a contemporary craft fair, bridging Georgia's past and present",
    "The multilingual environment where Georgian, Russian, and limited English create a unique linguistic tapestry",
    "That you can still find felt khinkali and khachapuri toys - playful modern takes on traditional Georgian cuisine",
    "The weather dependency adds authenticity - it's a real working market, not a permanent tourist installation",
    "Many vendors are eager to share the stories behind their items, turning shopping into an oral history lesson"
