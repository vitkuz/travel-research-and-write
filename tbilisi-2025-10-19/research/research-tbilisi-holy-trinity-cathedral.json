  "description": "The Holy Trinity Cathedral, known as Sameba, is the third-tallest Eastern Orthodox cathedral in the world and one of the largest religious buildings globally by total area. Standing majestically on Elia Hill overlooking the Mtkvari River, this architectural marvel was built between 1995-2004 to commemorate 1,500 years of autocephaly of the Georgian Orthodox Church and 2,000 years of Christianity. With its soaring 87-meter central dome topped by a 7.5-meter gilded gold cross, Sameba represents Georgia's post-Soviet national and spiritual revival, serving as a powerful symbol of Georgian resilience, faith, and identity after decades of Soviet repression.",
