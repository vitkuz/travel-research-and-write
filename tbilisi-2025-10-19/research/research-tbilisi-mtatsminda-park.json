    "origins": "In 1905, Belgian engineer Alphonse Roby designed a 500-meter-long funicular railway to connect lower Tbilisi with a planned 'Upper Tbilisi' residential development atop Mount Mtatsminda.

    "soviet_era": "During the Soviet period, Mtatsminda Park became immensely popular, ranking as the 3rd most visited public park in the entire Soviet Union. The park featured rides and attractions that entertained generations of Georgian families.",
    "post_soviet_decline": "Following the collapse of the Soviet Union and Georgia's independence, the park fell into disrepair and languished for years due to economic difficulties.",
    "modern_revival": "In 2007, a major revitalization project funded by a local businessman and philanthropist transformed the park into a modern amusement complex. An 80-meter Ferris wheel became the new centerpiece, and the entire facility was upgraded while maintaining its nostalgic character.",
