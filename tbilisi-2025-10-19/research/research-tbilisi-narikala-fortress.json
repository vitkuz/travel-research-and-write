  "unique_facts": [
    "The fortress served as an astronomical observatory during Arab rule in the 7th-8th centuries",
    "The name 'Narikala' comes from Mongol 'Naryn Kala' meaning 'Little Fortress', though locals originally called it 'Shuris-Tsihe' (Enviable Fortress)",
    "In 1827, lightning struck a Russian gunpowder storage building inside the fortress, causing a massive explosion that destroyed much of the structure - the effects were comparable to an earthquake",
    "The original 13th-century St. Nicholas Church was destroyed in a fire; the current version was completely rebuilt in 1996-1997 with new frescos",
    "The fortress was built on the strategic Silk Road route, making it one of the most fortified citadels in the entire Caucasus region",
    "Europa Nostra and the European Investment Bank Institute designated Narikala as one of Europe's most endangered cultural heritage sites in 2020, prompting current restoration efforts",
    "The 16th-century Istanbul Tower served as a prison during Turkish occupation and remains roofless to this day",
    "Most of the extant fortifications visible today date from the 16th and 17th centuries, not the original 4th-century Persian construction",
    "The fortress complex spans two walled sections on a steep hill between the sulfur baths and botanical gardens",
    "King David the Builder significantly expanded the fortress in the 11th-12th centuries during Georgia's Golden Age"
  ],
  "surprises": [
    "The fortress you see today is actually closed for renovations throughout most of 2025, with only lower grounds accessible - a significant surprise for visitors expecting full access",
    "Despite being Tbilisi's most iconic landmark, the fortress has been partially ruined since 1827 and has never been fully restored to its original state",
    "The 'ancient' St. Nicholas Church inside is actually less than 30 years old, rebuilt in the 1990s after Georgian independence",
    "You can visit for free 24/7 - no tickets, no gates, no closing time (when not under renovation)",
    "The fortress wasn't originally Georgian at all, but Persian, then Arab, then Mongol, before becoming a Georgian symbol",
    "The catastrophic 1827 destruction wasn't from war or invasion, but from an accidental lightning strike on ammunition stores",
    "The cable car, a thoroughly modern addition, has become as iconic as the ancient fortress itself and is often the more memorable part of the visit",
    "There's very little in the way of museums or exhibits - it's primarily about the views, the walls, and the atmosphere rather than curated historical displays",
    "The fortress is best experienced at sunset or night when the city lights create magic below, rather than during historical 'peak visiting hours'",
    "Many visitors report that the journey up (especially by cable car) and the panoramic views are more impressive than the fortress ruins themselves"
