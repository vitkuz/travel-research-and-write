  "type": "cultural",
  "description": "Dzveli Tbilisi is the historic heart of Georgia's capital, a labyrinth of narrow cobblestone streets and colorful wooden balconies that has been continuously inhabited for over 1,500 years. This living museum beneath Narikala Fortress showcases a remarkable blend of Eastern and Western architectural influences, with buildings spanning from the 5th to the 20th century. The Old Town is a testament to Tbilisi's tumultuous history under Persian, Arab, Turkish, and Russian rule, yet it maintains its distinct Georgian character through its unique architectural features, traditional wine cellars, sulfur baths, and the warmth of its residents.",

  "vibe": "A romantic, bohemian atmosphere where time seems to slow down. The Old Town pulses with a unique energy that blends medieval charm with contemporary Georgian life. Narrow alleys open onto sun-drenched courtyards, the scent of freshly baked bread mingles with sulfur from ancient baths, and every weathered facade tells stories of empires risen and fallen. Despite being a major tourist destination, it retains authenticity through locals going about daily life, children playing in courtyards, and elderly residents sitting on famous balconies. There's a palpable sense of resilience here - a place that has survived invasions, fires, and reconstructions yet maintains its soul. The vibe is simultaneously nostalgic and vibrant, ancient and alive.",
