## 🎬 Voiceover Script

### 1. The Hook - First Impressions (0:00-0:30)

Okay, so I'm walking across this bridge in Tbilisi, right? And it's called Dry Bridge. Which is hilarious because there's literally no water under it—just a street. Like, they drained the river in the 1940s and everyone just kept calling it a bridge. Classic Georgia energy.

And I'm thinking, "Okay, flea market. Probably some tourist souvenirs, maybe some old Soviet stuff." You know, the usual.

I wasn't expecting this.

### 2. The Initial Discovery (0:30-1:15)

First thing I see? World War II medals. Just laid out on a blanket. Stalin's face on a pin. Someone's Soviet ID book with their actual photo still inside. And I'm standing there thinking... whose grandmother's stuff is this? Like, whose actual life am I holding right now?

The vendor, this older guy, starts talking to me in Russian—because here's the thing, Russian is spoken more than Georgian at this market. These vendors, they lived through Soviet times. This isn't a staged tourist thing. This is their history. Their actual memories.

And I realize—holy shit—this isn't a flea market. This is a living museum. This is Georgia's attic, spread out in the open air.

**Scene Notes:** Close-ups of Soviet memorabilia, medals, ID books, vendor interactions

### 3. The Progressive Reveal - Two Personalities (1:15-2:15)

But then I walk to the other side, and it's completely different. Completely. Now it's handmade Georgian crafts. Felt khinkali toys—like, tiny stuffed dumplings, which is adorable and kind of insane. Drinking horns, traditional instruments, crochet work.

The market has this split personality. Soviet nostalgia on one side, contemporary Georgian creativity on the other. Past and present, just coexisting in these two parks next to each other.

And nobody's pushing you to buy anything. Like, not at all. I spent an hour just wandering, picking things up, and vendors would just... tell me stories. "This radio? My uncle fixed radios during the war." "These coins? From when we had different money every few years."

I wasn't shopping. I was getting an oral history lesson. From people who lived it.

You know what though? Some of this stuff isn't even real. There are Chinese reproductions mixed in. But that's the thing—you don't come here to be a serious collector. You come here because this place has soul.

**Scene Notes:** Transition shots between Soviet side and craft side, vendor conversations, close-ups of handmade items

### 4. The Deeper Layer - The Origin Story (2:15-3:00)

Here's what got me emotional though. Here's what got me.

This market started in the 1950s, but it really exploded during Perestroika. Early 1990s, when the Soviet Union collapsed and Georgia became independent. And people were desperate. Like, actually desperate. So they came here and sold their personal stuff. Their family heirlooms. Their memories.

That's why they call it "the market of memories." Because it literally is. It's not antiques—it's people's lives, turned into currency so they could survive.

And now? Now it's a community institution. Georgians come here to browse their own history. I saw locals, not tourists, just walking through, touching things, remembering.

It hit me that this market is Georgia in a nutshell. Resilient as hell. Taking the hardest moments and turning them into something beautiful, something communal. Not hiding the Soviet past in a museum—putting it in people's hands. Making it touchable. Real.

### 5. The Reflection - What I Learned (3:00-3:30)

I didn't buy much. A Soviet-era tin, some felt khachapuri toy that made me laugh. But I stayed for three hours. Three hours just... absorbing it.

Because this place taught me something. You can't understand Georgia—or any place, really—by just looking at the pretty stuff. You have to look at what people hold onto. What they refuse to throw away, even when times are brutal.

This market? It's messy, it's chaotic, half of it might be fake, and it only exists because a river got drained almost a century ago.

But it's real. It's so real it hurts.

And that's exactly why I came back the next weekend.
