## 🎬 Voiceover Script

### 1. Hook - The First Glimpse (0:00-0:45)

Okay, so you see her everywhere in Tbilisi. Everywhere. This massive aluminum woman towering over the city on Sololaki Hill. Twenty meters tall—that's like a six-story building, just standing there, watching everything. And I kept asking myself, who is she? Why is she holding a sword in one hand and a bowl of wine in the other? Like, what kind of symbolism is that?

I had to find out. I mean, you can't just ignore a twenty-meter woman staring down at you every single day, right?

So I went up there. And honestly? It changed how I see this entire country.

### 2. The Journey Up - Getting There (0:45-2:00)

I take the cable car from Rike Park. Twelve lari, cash only—of course cash only, because this is Georgia and half the city still runs on cash. Like, welcome to the 21st century but also not really, you know?

The ride up is quick, like couple minutes, but here's the thing though—the views during that ascent? Insane. Just insane. You're gliding over the Mtkvari River, seeing the Old Town spread out below you, those crooked balconies, the sulfur bath domes, and the whole city just opens up beneath your feet. I'm pressed against the window like some kid on their first flight, just staring.

I get to the top, walk toward the statue, and... okay, this is where it gets weird. You can only see her from behind. From behind! She's standing on the edge of this hill, facing out over the city, and all you get is the back view of this woman in traditional Georgian dress.

I'm standing there thinking, seriously? I came all this way to stare at her back?

But then I notice these stairs going down. And I'm like, oh, I get it now. You gotta work for the good view. You gotta earn it. Nothing in Georgia comes easy, does it? Even the tourist stuff makes you work for it.

### 3. The Reveal - Wine and Sword (2:00-3:45)

I walk down those stairs, and suddenly—suddenly I'm standing in front of her. Face to face with this massive figure. And now I can see it, really see it properly.

Left hand: a bowl of wine. Right hand: a sword.

And it hits me. It just hits me right there like a punch.

This is Georgia. This IS Georgia.

The wine bowl? That's for friends. For guests. For anyone who comes with good intentions. Georgians will literally pour you wine before they know your name—I've learned that the hard way. They'll toast to your health, your family, your dog, your future children you don't even have yet. Gaumarjos, they'll say. Cheers. Welcome. You're family now. Sit down, eat, drink, stay forever.

That's the wine bowl. That generosity, that openness, that "you're one of us now" energy that just wraps around you the second you arrive.

But that sword? That sword is for enemies. For anyone who comes to take, to destroy, to conquer. And Georgia's been conquered so many times—Persians, Mongols, Ottomans, Russians, Soviets. Everyone's tried to break this place. Everyone. For centuries, just wave after wave of invasions. But she's still here. Still standing. Still speaking Georgian, still making wine the ancient way, still defiant as hell.

Wine for friends. Sword for enemies. It's not subtle—it's straight up, as it is. No diplomatic bullshit, no pretending. Just pure Georgian character carved in aluminum and standing twenty meters high.

And honestly? I love that. I love that she doesn't apologize for holding both. She doesn't choose. She holds both truths at once.

### 4. The Story Behind Her (3:45-5:00)

And here's what I didn't expect. This statue? She started as a temporary wooden thing in 1958. Just wood, just temporary. They put her up for Tbilisi's 1500th anniversary—1500 years, can you even imagine? 1500 years this city has been here—thinking she'd come down after the celebrations.

But Georgians fell in love with her. Like, genuinely fell in love. They looked at this statue and said no, she stays. She stays. So they covered her in aluminum in 1963, made her permanent.

And get this—the sculptor, Elguja Amashukeli, he originally called her "Capital." Just "Capital." Some official boring name, right? But people started calling her Kartlis Deda—Mother of Georgia—and the name stuck so hard, so completely, that they officially changed it.

The people renamed her. Not the government. Not the artist. Not some committee. The people decided who she was.

She's been replaced once since then, in 1997, same exact design, just to preserve her. Because by then she wasn't just a statue anymore, you get it? She was identity. She was home. She was theirs.

Even though she's Soviet-era—and trust me, Georgians tore down plenty of Soviet monuments after independence, they were done with that shit—they kept her. They kept her. Because she transcended all that political garbage. She became something bigger. She became Georgia itself.

That's powerful, honestly. That's just... that's powerful.

### 5. Reflection - What She Means (5:00-6:00)

I'm standing up here, wind blowing through my hair, looking out at this city I've been calling home for months now. The sun's setting, turning everything gold and pink. And I get it. I finally get it.

Georgia is exactly like this statue. Exactly like her. Welcoming and fierce. Generous and unyielding. They'll feed you until you literally can't move, teach you toasts in Georgian, adopt you into their family after one dinner. One dinner. But cross them? Disrespect their culture, their history, their people, their wine? You'll see that sword real quick. Real quick.

I've learned that lesson. I've seen both sides. The wine bowl that never, ever empties, and the absolute refusal—the absolute refusal to be pushed around, to be diminished, to disappear.

And standing here, looking at Kartlis Deda watching over Tbilisi like she has for decades, I realize—this is what resilience looks like. Not just surviving. Not just enduring the bad shit that happens. But standing tall, standing proud, holding both wine and sword, saying: I welcome you with everything I have, but I will not break. I will not break for anyone.

Maybe that's what I love most about this place, you know? It doesn't apologize for being both. It doesn't choose one or the other. It holds both truths at once, in the same hands, at the same time.

Wine and sword. Hospitality and strength. Softness and steel. Georgia.

## 📝 Production Notes

- **Key Themes:** Dual nature of Georgian character, resilience through impossible history, how monuments become soul, earned understanding through exploration
- **Emotional Arc:** Curiosity → Frustration (back view) → Discovery (the stairs) → Understanding (wine and sword) → Deep appreciation (history and meaning) → Personal connection
- **Call to Action:** Implicit invitation to see Georgia beyond the surface welcome, to understand the complexity and strength beneath the generosity
