## Voiceover Script

### 1. The Setup - "I Wasn't Expecting This" (0:00-0:45)

Okay so I went to an amusement park in Tbilisi. An amusement park. Like, I came to Georgia chasing ancient churches and wine cellars and all that cultural stuff, right? And here I am, riding a funicular up a mountain to go on rides like I'm twelve years old again.

But here's the thing. Here's the thing. This isn't just some random amusement park. This is Mtatsminda. And Mtatsminda means "Holy Mountain." Holy. Like, sacred. And I'm going there for a Ferris wheel.

I had no idea what I was walking into.

**Scene Notes:** Funicular ascending, Lilia looking out the window, city getting smaller below, mix of curiosity and skepticism on her face

### 2. First Layer - The Ride Up (0:45-1:30)

So this funicular, this little cable car thing, it's from 1905. Nineteen-oh-five. Belgian engineer named Alphonse Roby built it to connect some fancy planned neighborhood that never happened. Instead, they made a park.

I'm sitting there, five-minute ride, watching Tbilisi drop away below me. The Mtkvari River turning into this golden ribbon in the late afternoon light. Red roofs, old balconies, Soviet blocks, all of it shrinking. And I'm thinking about how this same view, this exact same view, people have been watching it for over a hundred years. Same funicular. Same mountain.

The whole ride up, I kept smelling pine trees mixed with popcorn. Like nature and nostalgia fighting each other, you know?

**Scene Notes:** Views from funicular windows, city panorama, close-ups of old funicular mechanisms, golden hour lighting

### 3. Surface Discovery - The Park Itself (1:30-2:20)

I get to the top and okay, okay, it's charming as hell. There's this giant Bombora statue at the entrance—this chubby cartoon kid from some Soviet cartoon I've never heard of. Everyone's taking photos with him. Families, couples, old Georgian grandmas with their grandkids.

The park entrance is free. Free. You just buy a little card for your rides. One gel for the card, then rides are like one to five gel each. I'm talking maybe two, three dollars total to have a whole afternoon of fun.

And the Ferris wheel. This massive thing, eighty meters high, just sitting there on top of a mountain that's already 770 meters above sea level. I mean, come on. That's just absurd.

I got on. And honestly? Honestly, it was one of those moments where your brain just goes quiet. The whole city spread out below like someone opened a map. The Caucasus Mountains in the distance. Sunset starting to paint everything orange and pink.

**Scene Notes:** Bombora statue, families enjoying rides, Ferris wheel shots, views from the top, twinkling lights starting to come on as evening approaches

### 4. Deeper Layer - What I Didn't Expect (2:20-3:15)

But then I started walking around and I see this sign. Mtatsminda Pantheon. And I'm like, wait, what? There's a cemetery here?

Turns out, yeah. Right next to the amusement park. Fifty-three of Georgia's most distinguished people buried here. Writers, poets, artists. There's even this Russian diplomat, Griboyedov, and his Georgian wife Nino buried together. This whole romantic tragedy story.

And then there's this church. Mamadaviti Church. From the 1800s. But built on the spot where St. David—one of the original thirteen Assyrian fathers who brought Christianity to Georgia in the sixth century—where he lived in a cave he carved into the rock. A cave. On this mountain.

So I'm standing there, between a roller coaster and a holy site, and it hits me. This place, this whole mountain, it's been sacred for like 1400 years. Way before the funicular, way before the Soviet-era rides, way before any of this.

And during Soviet times? In the 1930s? This was the third most visited park in the entire Soviet Union. Third. Only behind Gorky Park in Moscow. Generations of Georgian families came here. Made memories here.

**Scene Notes:** Pantheon gates, gravestones with Georgian script, Mamadaviti Church exterior, cave entrance, old Soviet-era photos overlaid with modern footage

### 5. Reflection - What This Taught Me (3:15-4:00)

I came up here thinking I'd just get some nice views, maybe ride a couple rides for the nostalgia. But what I actually found was this perfect metaphor for Georgia itself.

Layers, you know? Layers upon layers. Ancient spirituality mixed with Soviet nostalgia mixed with modern revival mixed with families just trying to have a good day. And somehow it all works together. It doesn't fight itself. It just exists.

After it got dark, the park transformed. All these lights came on, the city below lit up like stars had fallen, and I sat there on a bench eating ice cream, watching families laugh and kids scream on rides, and I thought about St. David in his cave 1400 years ago.

I've been chasing the next place, the next destination, the next experience for so long. Always moving, always searching. But maybe, maybe that's not the point. Maybe the point is this. Finding the sacred in the unexpected. Finding depth in a place you almost dismissed. Finding peace on a Holy Mountain disguised as an amusement park.

Tbilisi keeps teaching me to slow down. Keeps teaching me that the best things aren't the ones you plan for. They're the ones that surprise you when you're not even looking.

Trust me on this one. Go to Mtatsminda. Ride the funicular. Get on that Ferris wheel at sunset. Then walk over to the Pantheon. Stand in that church. Feel the weight of 1400 years under your feet.

It'll change something in you. I promise.

**Scene Notes:** Night shots of illuminated park, city lights twinkling below, Lilia on a bench with ice cream, final shot of Ferris wheel lit up against dark sky with Tbilisi glowing below
