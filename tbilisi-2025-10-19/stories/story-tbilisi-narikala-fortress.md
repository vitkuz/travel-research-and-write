## 🎬 Voiceover Script

### 1. The Setup (0:00-1:15)

Okay, so. Narikala Fortress. Everyone told me—everyone—that this is THE thing you do in Tbilisi. The heart and soul of the city, right? Ancient fortress, incredible views, cable car ride up the mountain. I've been living here for weeks and I kept putting it off, kept saying "I'll go tomorrow, I'll go next week."

And then this morning I woke up and just... decided. No planning, no research. Just grabbed my camera and headed to Rike Park to catch that cable car everyone talks about.

Here's the thing though. Here's the thing. I'm standing at the cable car station, 2.5 GEL for a ticket, and there's this sign. In Georgian. And a little bit of English. And it says... the fortress is closed. Closed. For renovations. Until end of summer 2025.

I literally laughed. Like, out loud laughed. Because of course. Of course I finally decide to go and it's under construction.

But you know what? I'm already here. Cable car's running. And honestly, I'm curious now. What do you even do at a closed fortress? Let's find out.

**Scene Notes:** Opening with cable car station, the renovation sign visible, Lilia's frustrated-but-amused expression. Quick cuts of Tbilisi morning streets leading to Rike Park.

### 2. The Ascent (1:15-2:45)

So I get in this cable car—these little glass bubbles, right?—and immediately, immediately, I forget about the whole closed-fortress situation.

Because this view. Holy shit, this view.

We're gliding over the Mtkvari River, over the Old Town with all those wooden balconies, over the sulfur bath domes that look like little turtle shells from up here. The city's just... spreading out below me. All peachy-pink buildings, all those twisting streets I've gotten lost in like a hundred times.

And the cable car is so quiet. Just this gentle humming. I'm watching other tourists taking selfies, but I'm just... I'm just looking. You know? Just watching Tbilisi shrink and expand at the same time. Sounds weird, but that's how it feels.

Three minutes up. Three minutes. That's all it takes. And when I step out at the top, the air is different. Cooler. There's this breeze that smells like... I don't know, like stone and pine trees and something else I can't name.

I can see the fortress walls ahead. Weathered limestone, ancient, crumbling in places. And yeah, there's construction fencing. There's barriers. But here's what nobody told me—you can still walk around. The lower grounds are open. St. Nicholas Church is accessible.

Turns out "closed" doesn't mean you can't experience anything. It just means you gotta adjust your expectations.

**Scene Notes:** Cable car journey with sweeping aerial views of Tbilisi, the Mtkvari River, Old Town rooftops. Transition to arrival at upper station, first glimpse of fortress walls with construction barriers visible.

### 3. Walking Among Ruins (2:45-4:30)

So I start walking. And the fortress—what I can access of it—it's not what I expected at all.

I was picturing, like, a museum vibe, you know? Plaques everywhere explaining history, guided tours, selfie spots with professional lighting. But no. No, it's just... raw. It's stones and walls and these massive archways that frame the city below like it's a painting.

There's hardly anyone here. Maybe because of the renovations, maybe because it's still morning. But I'm basically alone with these walls that have been standing here since—what did I read?—4th century. Persian fortress. Then Arab, then Mongol, then Georgian.

Like, this place has seen everything. Silk Road caravans. Invasions. Kingdoms rising and falling. And in 1827, lightning struck a gunpowder storage building right here and the whole thing exploded. Can you imagine? Not destroyed by war. Destroyed by a freak accident, by nature just saying "nope, not today."

And they never fully rebuilt it. What I'm walking through right now—these walls, these ruins—they're from the 1500s, 1600s. Mixed with modern reconstruction. It's a palimpsest, that's the word. Layers upon layers of history just stacked on top of each other.

I find St. Nicholas Church. It looks ancient, right? All these beautiful frescos inside, Biblical scenes mixed with Georgian history. But then I remember—I read this somewhere—this church is from 1996. Like, younger than me. The original burned down, and they just... rebuilt it in the '90s after independence.

So even the "ancient" parts aren't always ancient. And somehow that makes it more real to me. More honest. Tbilisi isn't a museum city preserving itself in amber. It's living, rebuilding, constantly changing while still holding onto its past.

I'm not gonna lie—part of me is still disappointed I can't explore the upper fortress sections. But standing here, looking at these weathered stones, feeling the wind... I get it. I get why locals call this the heart of the city.

**Scene Notes:** Walking along accessible fortress walls, close-ups of weathered limestone, archways framing city views. Interior of St. Nicholas Church with frescos. Quiet, contemplative pacing with ambient sound of wind and distant city noise.

### 4. The View That Changes Everything (4:30-5:45)

And then I reach this viewpoint. This spot where the wall opens up and the entire city—the ENTIRE city—is just laid out below me.

I can see the Bridge of Peace, that glass and steel thing that looks like it belongs in the future. I can see the Old Town's maze of streets, the Mtkvari River snaking through everything. I can see the modern towers mixing with Soviet blocks mixing with 19th-century buildings. I can see mountains in the distance, hazy and blue.

And I just... I stop. I sit down on this ancient stone, and I stop.

You know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking about how I almost didn't come. How I was annoyed about the closure, how I thought "what's the point if I can't see everything?"

But here's the thing. The fortress isn't the point. The fortress is just the excuse to get up here, to this exact spot, at this exact moment, and see the city I've been living in from completely outside of it.

Down there, I'm in it. I'm in the chaos, the narrow streets, the language I don't fully understand, the daily survival of being a nomad in a foreign city. But up here? Up here I can breathe. Up here I can see the shape of things. The pattern.

And I realize—this is why people climb mountains. Not for the mountain itself. For the perspective. For the reminder that you're small and the world is big and that's actually... comforting. You know?

My problems, my anxieties, my constant overthinking—from up here, it all looks tiny. Manageable. Just another part of the city's chaos, no bigger or smaller than anything else.

**Scene Notes:** Panoramic shots of Tbilisi from fortress viewpoint, golden morning light. Lilia sitting on fortress wall, wind in her hair, genuine moment of reflection. Slow, cinematic pacing with ambient sound.

### 5. The Walk Down and What I Learned (5:45-6:30)

I stay up there for like an hour. Maybe more. Until the sun gets too hot and the tourists start arriving in bigger groups.

On the way down—I take the stairs this time, I want to walk through the Old Town—I'm thinking about how this whole experience is such a perfect metaphor for my life right now.

I came for one thing, the fortress fully open and accessible. Got something completely different, a closed site with limited access. And at first I was frustrated, ready to write it off as bad timing, bad luck.

But if I'd come when everything was "perfect"? When the fortress was fully open and crowded with tours and I was just another tourist following the guidebook path? I don't think I would've had that moment. That quiet, alone-with-my-thoughts moment on the wall.

Sometimes the best experiences are the ones that don't go according to plan. The ones where you have to improvise, adjust, find the beauty in what's actually there instead of what you expected to be there.

Narikala's been standing here for like 1700 years. Survived Persians, Arabs, Mongols, explosions, earthquakes, renovations. It'll still be here when the construction is done. But this morning, this imperfect, closed, under-renovation morning? This morning was mine.

And honestly, I wouldn't trade it for anything.

So yeah. If you're in Tbilisi right now, in 2025, and you're reading that the fortress is closed—go anyway. Take the cable car. Walk the lower grounds. Sit on those ancient stones. Let the city surprise you.

Because it will. Trust me on this. It absolutely will.

**Scene Notes:** Walking down fortress steps into Old Town, cobblestone streets, morning light filtering through balconies. Final shot of Lilia looking back up at fortress from below, cable car visible in background. Warm, conclusive tone.

## 📝 Production Notes

- **Key Themes:** Expectations vs reality, finding beauty in imperfection, perspective shifts, solo travel contemplation, embracing the unexpected
- **Emotional Arc:** Frustration (closed fortress) → Curiosity (going anyway) → Awe (cable car views) → Reflection (among ruins) → Revelation (the view) → Acceptance and gratitude (walking down)
- **Call to Action:** Visit despite renovation closure; embrace imperfect travel experiences; seek perspective over perfection
- **Tone Consistency:** Raw, conversational, stream-of-consciousness with moments of genuine vulnerability and philosophical reflection. Authentic to Lilia's voice with natural topic jumps and self-aware commentary.
