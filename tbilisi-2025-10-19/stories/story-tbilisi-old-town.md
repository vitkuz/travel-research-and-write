## 🎬 Voiceover Script

### 1. The Hook - Arrival & Disorientation (0:00-0:35)

Okay, so Tbilisi Old Town. Everyone told me - everyone - "You HAVE to see the balconies, the churches, the sulfur baths." Right? I show up with my little saved Instagram map, my list of must-see spots, and I'm like... ready. Ready to check off this perfectly preserved medieval fairy tale.

First morning I get completely, utterly lost. Like, I mean lost lost. These cobblestone streets twist like they're actively trying to confuse you. My phone dies - of course it dies - and I'm standing there looking at these colorful wooden balconies thinking "Okay, cool, Instagram was right about that part at least."

But here's what nobody told me...

**Scene Notes:** Montage of narrow winding streets, colorful balconies, getting turned around at intersections, looking at dead phone

### 2. Reality Check - This Isn't a Museum (0:35-1:20)

This isn't some preserved medieval museum. It's... people's actual homes. Like, there's laundry hanging from those famous Instagram balconies. Satellite dishes. Kids playing soccer in courtyards. An old Georgian woman yelling at her neighbor about something - I don't speak Georgian but the tone was universal, you know?

I'm reading my guidebook like "founded 5th century, ancient churches, blah blah" and then I find out - and this blew my mind - most of this was actually destroyed in 1795. Completely destroyed. Persian invasion, burned it down. What I'm seeing? Mostly 19th century. Some older stuff survived, yeah, but it's this crazy mix. Like you've got a 6th-century church next to a Soviet apartment block next to some modern renovation, and it's all just... coexisting. Chaotically. Beautifully.

And I realized I'd been looking for the wrong thing. I wanted pristine historical perfection. But Tbilisi Old Town, it's not pristine. It's alive. It's messy. It's real.

### 3. The Shift - Surrendering to the Maze (1:20-2:25)

So I stopped following my map. Stopped trying to find things. Just... walked.

That's when I started actually seeing it. You know what I mean? The smell of fresh bread from bakeries I couldn't even find the entrance to. The sulfur smell drifting up from the baths - that warm, eggy smell that should be gross but somehow isn't. Church bells mixing with mosque calls to prayer - there's this mosque, the Jumah Mosque, where Sunni and Shia pray together. Together. Only place in the world like that.

I stumbled into this hidden courtyard - like, you'd never find it if you were trying to find it - and there's this elderly woman selling churchkhela. You know, those candle-shaped walnut things? She sees me, immediately starts talking in Georgian, gesturing wildly. I don't understand a single word but she's insisting I try one. She won't let me pay. Won't. Let. Me. Pay.

That Georgian hospitality everyone talks about? It's not exaggerated. If anything, it's undersold. It's overwhelming at first - like, "why is this stranger so aggressively kind to me?" - but then you realize it's just... how it is here.

### 4. The Hidden Discoveries - What You Find When You're Not Looking (2:25-3:20)

I found this tiny wine shop - "Old Generation" - run by this grandmother who basically invited me into what felt like her living room. There's qvevri wine - that UNESCO thing, you know, wine made in these clay vessels buried in the ground. Ancient method. She's pouring me samples, showing me photos of her family, and I'm sitting there thinking "Is this even a shop or did I just walk into someone's house?"

Then there's the Gabriadze clock tower - okay, this one I did mean to find - but the surprise was the little golden angel that comes out every hour to strike the bell. And get this, the theater changed its street number from 13 to 12+1. Because why not? It's that kind of place.

I walked down these steep stairs - Betlemi Stairs, built in 1850 by local craftsmen who just... pooled their money to build infrastructure for their city. How beautiful is that? And you're walking down and suddenly there's this panoramic view of the whole city you weren't expecting.

Every corner, every random turn - there's something. A street cat sleeping in a doorway. A hidden synagogue. That Soviet mosaic everyone ignores. The "Italian courtyards" that have nothing to do with Italy and nobody knows why they're called that.

The best parts aren't on any map.

**Scene Notes:** Wine tasting in tiny shop, clock tower angel, steep stairs with panoramic reveal, street cats, architectural details, hidden courtyards

### 5. The Reflection - What Old Town Actually Taught Me (3:20-4:00)

Here's the thing I learned. Here's the thing. Tbilisi Old Town doesn't work if you're trying to conquer it. You can't check it off a list. You can't "do" it efficiently.

It rewards getting lost. It rewards slowing down. It rewards talking to strangers who don't speak your language, following smells instead of maps, walking into places you're not sure you're allowed to be in.

I came looking for that perfect Instagram shot of colorful balconies. And yeah, I got that. But what I actually found was this 1,500-year-old neighborhood that's been invaded, burned, rebuilt, survived empires and wars and occupations - and it's still here. Still lived in. Still warm. Still Georgian as hell despite centuries of everyone trying to make it something else.

It's not a fairy tale. It's better than that. It's real.

And honestly? Getting lost was the whole point.
