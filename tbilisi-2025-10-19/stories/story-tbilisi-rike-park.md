## 🎬 Voiceover Script

### 1. Hook - The Setup (0:00-0:20)

Okay, so Rike Park. Here's the thing—everyone goes to Rike Park in Tbilisi. Everyone. It's where you catch the cable car up to Narikala, walk across that insane LED bridge, take your Instagram shots. Standard tourist checklist, right?

But I spent three weeks walking through this park before I realized—like, literally realized—I was walking across an entire map of Georgia. The whole damn country. Under my feet.

**Scene Notes:** Wide establishing shot of Rike Park from above, showing pathway patterns, then ground level entering the park

### 2. Discovery Begins - The Origin Story (0:20-0:55)

Let me back up. 2010. You know what was here? A giant asphalt field. Just... asphalt. Where people practiced driving. That's it. Boring, ugly, useless space on the most beautiful riverbank in Old Tbilisi.

Then this Italian architect, Michele De Lucchi, shows up and says, "I'm gonna turn your driving practice lot into the future." And he did.

Now you've got these massive futuristic metal tubes—supposed to be a concert hall and exhibition center. Supposed to be. They've been "supposed to be" for years now. Still unfinished. But honestly? They look incredible just sitting there, like giant metallic caterpillars that crashed into the riverbank.

**Scene Notes:** B-roll of metallic tubular structures, low angle shots, Bridge of Peace with LED lights beginning to glow

### 3. Progressive Reveals - The Details That Blow Your Mind (0:55-1:50)

The pathways? They form Georgia's regions. The whole park is literally a map of the country when viewed from above. I mean... what? Who thinks of this?

And the giant white piano—you can actually play it. Jump on the keys, make music. I've seen Georgian grandmas playing folk melodies on this thing with their grandkids. It's not some Instagram prop. People use it.

Life-size chessboard? Old men playing serious games. Tournament-level concentration.

The Bridge of Peace—glass and steel, thousands of LED lights. At night it becomes this living, breathing light show. Not just pretty. Borderline surreal.

Then the cable car. You can't use cash. You need a Metromoney Card. A metro card. For a cable car. I watched tourists get turned away because they showed up with cash and... nope. Sorry. Card only. Two and a half lari, but first you gotta get that card.

**Scene Notes:** Quick cuts—piano being played, chess game, Bridge of Peace at night with LEDs, tourists confused at cable car entrance

### 4. The Unexpected Finding - Going Beyond the Obvious (1:50-2:35)

So I take the cable car up. Five to seven minutes floating above Tbilisi. Old town on one side, Kura River snaking below, mountains everywhere. Breathtaking.

But then—best decision—I walked down instead of taking the cable car back. Hidden mountain trails. Winding paths through hills, past little neighborhoods, street dogs napping in the sun, old Soviet buildings mixed with new construction. Nobody tells you about these trails. They're just there, waiting.

And that wind—holy shit, the wind up there. Even in summer. Brutal. Hold-onto-your-phone brutal. Dress warm. Don't be that person in a tank top shivering on the fortress walls.

**Scene Notes:** Cable car ride POV, aerial city views, hiking trail footage with street dogs and neighborhood scenes, person bundling up against wind

### 5. Reflection & The Real Magic (2:35-3:30)

Here's what I learned about Rike Park. It's not just a park. It's Tbilisi's entire philosophy in one place—ancient history meeting aggressive modernity, locals and tourists existing together without resentment, beauty that doesn't apologize for being bold.

That asphalt driving lot? It became art. It became a cultural hub hosting Tbilisoba Festival every October, International Theatre Festival, massive concerts. It became a place where Georgian families picnic on weekends and backpackers wait for sunset.

And at night? The real magic. The park transforms completely. Bridge of Peace lights up, musical fountain show starts—rivals any European capital, honestly—metallic structures reflecting everything.

That's Tbilisi. Always transforming, always surprising you, always refusing to be just one thing.

So yeah. Rike Park. Go for the cable car, stay for the giant piano, leave wondering how many other "obvious" tourist spots you've completely misunderstood.

**Scene Notes:** Golden hour shots of families, musical fountain show, Bridge of Peace illuminated, final wide shot with park, bridge, cable car all in frame at night
