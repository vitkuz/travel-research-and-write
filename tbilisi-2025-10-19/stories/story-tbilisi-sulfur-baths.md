### 1. Hook - "I heard about this place..." (0:00-0:30)

Okay so, Tbilisi. Tbilisi literally means "warm place." And I'm standing in Abanotubani right now—the sulfur bath district—where this city was born fifteen hundred years ago. Fifteen hundred.

There's this legend, right? King Vakhtang is out hunting, his falcon catches a pheasant, both birds fall into hot springs, and boom—the king discovers these healing waters and builds a whole damn city around them.

I thought I was going for some spa day. Like, relax, hot water, maybe a massage. That's what I thought.

I had no idea what I was actually signing up for.

### 2. Arrival & First Impressions (0:30-1:15)

First thing that hits you? The smell. Sulfur. It's like... rotten eggs mixed with earth and history. You either love it or you absolutely hate it, and honestly? I wasn't sure which camp I was in yet.

These dome buildings—they look like molehills coming out of the ground. Persian-inspired architecture with these turquoise and blue tiles at Chreli-Abano. It's gorgeous, like stepping into some Silk Road fantasy. But here's the thing—this isn't decorative. Those domes? They're functional. Natural light comes in, sulfuric steam goes out. Fifteen centuries of engineering.

I booked a private room at Bathhouse No. 5. Took off all my jewelry—sulfur reacts with silver, they warned me—and went in. The water's naturally 38 to 45 degrees Celsius. No modern heating. Just the earth, doing its thing for over a thousand years.

I'm sitting in this stone pool and I'm thinking... okay, this is nice. Warm. Ancient. Therapeutic.

I still had no idea.

### 3. The Kisi Scrub Revelation (1:15-2:15)

Then this woman comes in. She's holding what looks like a textured mitt—a kisi. And she says, "Lie down."

No "hello," no "are you ready." Just "lie down."

Let me tell you something about the kisi scrub. Let me tell you. It's not a gentle spa massage. It's not aromatherapy with soft music. It's a vigorous, intense, full-body exfoliation where a complete stranger basically scrubs layers of dead skin off your body. Layers. Like, you can see it rolling off in visible clumps. I'm watching this happen and I'm thinking—holy shit, that was ON me? That was part of me?

It's intense. It can feel borderline aggressive if you're not expecting it. But here's what I realized—this is the authentic experience. This is what Georgians have been doing for centuries. Alexandre Dumas came here in 1858, stayed for over a month, and literally worried he'd never experience baths this good again in Paris. Pushkin praised them. Chekhov visited.

This isn't a tourist gimmick. This is real.

And you know what? After the initial shock—after you surrender to the intensity—it feels incredible. Like you're shedding more than just dead skin. You're shedding stress, tension, all the shit you carry around.

### 4. Cultural Context & Unexpected Depth (2:15-3:00)

Here's what I didn't expect though. Here's what really got me.

These baths? They weren't just for hygiene. They were social hubs. Business deals happened here. Weddings were celebrated here. Mothers-in-law would bring potential brides to observe them—like, literally inspect them—as part of matchmaking rituals. Can you imagine? You're just trying to bathe and some future in-law is sizing you up.

And Abanotubani itself—this tiny district has every major religious building packed together. Georgian Orthodox church, Armenian church, Catholic church, mosque, synagogue, even a Zoroastrian fire temple. All within walking distance. All coexisting. That's Tbilisi for you—layers of history, cultures, faiths, all mixed together like the sulfur and water in these springs.

At its peak in the 13th century, Tbilisi had 65 bathhouses. Now? Fewer than a dozen remain. And locals still use them regularly. I saw Georgian families coming in with towels and soap, chatting with the attendants like they've known them for years. Because they probably have.

This isn't preserved for tourists. It's living tradition.

### 5. Reflection - "You have to experience this" (3:00-3:30)

I spent two hours in there. Two hours. You're supposed to limit your time in the sulfur water—12 minutes max per dip, four dips total, or you'll overheat. But between dips, you just... sit. Breathe. Exist.

And I get it now. I get why this city was built around these springs. It's not just about the water. It's about slowing down. Surrendering. Letting someone else take care of you—even if "care" means scrubbing you raw with a textured mitt.

When I left, my skin felt like silk. Like actual silk. And I felt lighter. Not just cleaner—lighter.

If you come to Tbilisi and you skip this? You're missing the whole point. You're missing what this city is named after. What it was built for. The warm place. The healing place.

Trust me on this—let them scrub you. All of you. It's worth it.
