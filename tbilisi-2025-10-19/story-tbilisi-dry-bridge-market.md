## 🎬 Voiceover Script

### 1. The Hook: Low Expectations (0:00-0:35)

Okay so, Dry Bridge Market. I'm gonna be honest with you—when I first heard about it, I was like, yeah yeah, another flea market. Tourists love flea markets, right? Buy some magnets, maybe a scarf, call it a day.

But here's the thing. Here's the thing. This market? It's not what I thought. Like, not even close.

I'm standing here on this actual dry bridge—and yeah, it's literally dry, the river got redirected in the '40s—and I'm looking at what locals call "the market of memories." And I'm thinking... memories of what exactly?

Let me show you.

### 2. First Layer: The Surface (0:35-1:20)

So first glance? It looks like any outdoor market. Tables everywhere, people browsing, vendors chatting. Standard stuff.

But then I start walking. And I'm not seeing... tourist crap, you know? I'm seeing war medals. World War II medals. Actual medals from actual soldiers. Soviet ID books with black-and-white photos of people who lived through Stalin. Old photographs—like family photographs—just sitting there on tables.

And I'm like... wait. This isn't a market. This is someone's attic. This is someone's life.

Turns out—and this hit me hard when I learned this—this market started during Perestroika. Early '90s. People were desperate. Desperate. So they came here and sold their personal stuff. Their family heirlooms. Their memories. Just to survive.

That's why they call it the market of memories. It's not a cute name. It's literal.

### 3. The Surprise: Dual Personality (1:20-2:15)

But wait, it gets weirder. Better weird, not bad weird.

The market has this split personality. On one side? All the Soviet nostalgia stuff. Stalin memorabilia—which, I'm not gonna lie, feels heavy to look at. Lenin pins. Vintage cameras. Enamel engravings. It's like walking through a museum, except everything's for sale and there's this old guy smoking a cigarette who'll tell you the whole story if you ask in Russian.

Oh yeah—Russian is spoken more than Georgian here. That's how Soviet this market still is.

But then—then—you walk to the other side. And it's completely different. Handmade Georgian crafts. Felt khinkali toys. Khachapuri felt toys. Like, adorable little stuffed dumplings and cheese bread. Drinking horns. Panduri instruments. Local artists selling paintings.

It's like the market can't decide if it's mourning the past or celebrating the present. And honestly? I think it's doing both. At the same time.

### 4. The Human Connection (2:15-3:15)

So I stop at this one table. Old guy. Maybe 70s. He's got vintage vinyl records, some porcelain, a few coins.

And I ask him—in broken Russian, my Russian is terrible—I ask him about this one coin. Georgian coin from like the 1920s.

And he just... lights up. Starts telling me the story. Not of the coin—of his grandfather who collected coins. How this was his grandfather's, and now it's here because... well, because life happens, right? Because he needs the money more than the memories right now.

But he doesn't seem sad about it. He seems almost... relieved? Like he's passing these stories on. Like selling them isn't losing them—it's sharing them.

That's when I got it. This market isn't about buying old stuff. It's about keeping history alive. Not in museums where you can't touch anything. But here. In your hands. Where you can hold someone's past and decide if it becomes part of your future.

And the vendors—man, they're not pushy at all. You can just window shop. Just browse. They're cool with it. Some of them just want to talk, share stories, practice their English or Russian.

### 5. The Reflection: What It Really Is (3:15-4:00)

I came here thinking it's a flea market. Some place to kill an hour, maybe buy a weird Soviet pin for laughs.

But I stayed for three hours. Three hours. And I didn't even buy that much—just one felt khachapuri toy because, I mean, come on, it's adorable.

But what I left with? It's this feeling that Tbilisi doesn't let you just observe. It pulls you in. It makes you part of the story.

This market—it started from desperation, from people selling their lives to survive. But somehow, somehow it became this community thing. This place where Georgians come to browse their own history. Where the Soviet past and Georgian present just... coexist. On tables. Under the sky.

And maybe that's what makes Tbilisi special. It doesn't erase the hard parts. It doesn't hide the messy history. It just lays it all out. Literally. On the Dry Bridge. And says, "Here. This is us. Take what resonates."

I don't know, maybe you'll find something different there. But for me? Best "flea market" I've ever been to. And I'm not even calling it that anymore.

It's a living museum. And you're invited.

## 📝 Production Notes

- **Key Themes:** Survival turned into community; memory as commodity and connection; Georgian resilience; coexistence of painful past and hopeful present
- **Emotional Arc:** Skepticism → Curiosity → Surprise → Deep emotional connection → Reflective appreciation
- **Call to Action:** Implicit invitation to visit and experience the market themselves; reframe expectations from "flea market" to "living museum"
- **Voice Consistency:** Stream-of-consciousness pacing, self-aware commentary, emotional vulnerability when discovering vendor's story, repetition for emphasis ("Here's the thing"), direct viewer address ("Let me show you")
