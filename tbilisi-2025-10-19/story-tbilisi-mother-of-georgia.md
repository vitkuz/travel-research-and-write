## 🎬 Voiceover Script

### 1. The Skeptical Arrival (0:00-0:35)

Okay, so. Mother of Georgia. Kartlis Deda. This massive statue looming over Tbilisi that you can see from like, everywhere. Twenty meters tall. Aluminum. Soviet-era.

I'll be honest - when I first got here, I thought it was just another Communist monument, you know? The kind that every post-Soviet city debates tearing down. But Georgians? They didn't tear her down. They keep her lit up at night. They rebuilt her when she got old.

And I needed to understand why.

### 2. The Journey Up (0:35-1:15)

So I'm taking this cable car from Rike Park. Cable car tickets - cash only, of course, because Georgia loves keeping you on your toes. Twelve lari return. The car lifts off and suddenly I'm suspended over the Mtkvari River, Old Town spreading out below like this chaotic, beautiful maze.

Two minutes. That's all it takes. Two minutes and you're transported from street level chaos to this hilltop next to Narikala Fortress. And there she is. This woman in traditional Georgian dress, twenty meters of aluminum power, holding... wait. What is she holding?

Left hand - a bowl of wine. Right hand - a sword.

And that's when it clicked. That's when I got it.

**Scene Notes:** Cable car ride POV, city views during ascent, reveal of statue from behind

### 3. The Symbolism Unlocked (1:15-2:15)

Here's the thing about Georgia, and I mean this. This country greets you with wine and warmth like nowhere else I've been. Gaumarjos at every table, strangers inviting you to feast, that ridiculous, overwhelming hospitality that makes you feel guilty for not speaking Georgian fluently.

But cross them? Threaten what they love? You get the sword.

That's what she represents. That's what this whole statue is screaming without saying a word. Wine for friends. Steel for enemies. And Georgians will tell you - straight up, as it is - that's exactly who they are.

The sculptor, Elguja Amashukeli, he made her in 1958 for Tbilisi's 1500th anniversary. Started as wood, can you believe that? Wooden statue. But people loved her so much they covered her in aluminum in 1963, rebuilt her entirely in 1997. She was supposed to be temporary. She became eternal.

He called her 'Capital.' Georgians said 'nope, she's Kartlis Deda - Mother of Georgia.' And guess what? The official name changed. The people won.

**Scene Notes:** Close-ups of wine bowl, sword, traditional dress details; cutaways to Georgian feast scenes, toasting

### 4. The Surprise Reality (2:15-3:00)

Now here's what nobody tells you. When you arrive at the top, you can only see her from behind. She's standing on the edge of the hill, facing the city. Protecting it. You have to walk down these stairs to get the frontal view, the Instagram shot, the one with her face.

At first I was annoyed - like, really? I came all this way - but then I realized. That's the point. She's not performing for tourists. She's watching over Tbilisi.

And the views? Holy shit, the views. Three-sixty degrees of city, river, mountains, the whole chaotic gorgeous spread of it. There's little cafes up here too, which I wasn't expecting. You can sit, drink coffee, watch the sun drop behind the hills while she stands there, backlit, eternal.

Morning, sunset, night when she's illuminated and glowing - doesn't matter when you come. The feeling stays the same. Powerful. Protective. Proud.

**Scene Notes:** Walking around statue, discovering viewing angle limitation, panoramic city views, cafe culture, sunset/night illumination

### 5. The Reflection (3:00-3:30)

You know what though? After nine years of moving through post-Soviet countries, seeing monuments torn down, histories erased, symbols rejected... this one survived because it actually means something.

It's not about the regime that commissioned it. It's about what Georgians saw in it. What they still see. A mother who will feed you until you're bursting and defend you until her last breath.

I get it now. I get why she's still standing.

Maybe that's the thing about symbols. The best ones don't tell you who you should be. They show you who you already are.
