## 🎬 Voiceover Script

### 1. Opening Hook (0:00-0:25)

Okay so, confession time. I almost didn't go to Mtatsminda Park. I mean, an amusement park? On top of a mountain? In Tbilisi? It sounded... I don't know, kinda touristy. Kinda predictable. Like something you'd skip if you're trying to be a "real traveler," you know?

But here's the thing. Here's the thing though. I was so, so wrong.

**Scene Notes:** Opening shots of funicular ascending, mountain views, Ferris wheel lit up against twilight sky

### 2. First Impressions - The Funicular Journey (0:25-1:00)

So I take this funicular from the bottom of the city. And already—already—I'm like, wait, this thing is from 1905. Like, literally over a hundred years old. Designed by some Belgian engineer named Alphonse Roby. And as we're climbing, climbing up this mountain, I'm watching Tbilisi unfold below me. The red rooftops, the Mtkvari River turning gold in the afternoon light, all these winding streets getting smaller and smaller.

And I realize... the journey up is already an experience. Not just transportation. An actual experience.

**Scene Notes:** Inside funicular, views through windows, ascending angle showing city spreading below, historic interior details

### 3. Progressive Discoveries - The Park Itself (1:00-2:30)

We get to the top and okay, here's where it gets interesting. The entrance? Free. Completely free. You heard that right. You only pay for the rides you actually want. I was not expecting that.

And then there's this... this giant whimsical statue called Bombora. It's from this old Soviet cartoon—a playful giant child. And something about seeing it there, greeting everyone at the entrance, it just made me smile. Like, instantly smile.

But let me tell you what nobody tells you about this place. It's not just an amusement park. It's like... layers. Like an onion, but a good onion. A nostalgia onion? Okay that sounds weird, but stay with me.

There are these rides—some of them totally renovated and modern, some of them with that Soviet-era charm that feels like stepping into a time machine. Kids everywhere, families eating ice cream, and then I get on the Ferris wheel. This massive 80-meter-high Ferris wheel.

And holy shit. Holy shit, you guys. The view from the top? I'm looking at the entire city—360 degrees of Tbilisi spread out like a map. The TV tower right there. The mountains in the distance. And as the sun starts setting, the city lights begin twinkling on, one by one, and I'm just... I'm just sitting there in this Ferris wheel cabin, and I feel this unexpected wave of emotion.

Because here's what I didn't expect. I didn't expect to feel so... peaceful. So present. Like time stopped for a minute.

**Scene Notes:** Free entrance sign, Bombora statue close-up, montage of rides (both nostalgic and modern), families enjoying themselves, Ferris wheel ascending, panoramic city views, golden hour lighting, night lights beginning to illuminate

### 4. Unexpected Depth - The Hidden Layers (2:30-3:05)

And then I learn that this mountain—Mtatsminda means "Holy Mountain." It's named after Saint David, one of the Assyrian fathers who brought Christianity to Georgia in the sixth century. He lived in a cave right here. Right where I'm standing with a funnel cake in my hand.

Just down the path, there's the Mtatsminda Pantheon—where Georgia's most distinguished writers and artists are buried. Including Griboyedov and his wife Nino. There's this 19th-century church, Mamadaviti, built on the exact spot where Saint David's cave was.

So what looks like just a fun day out is actually... it's a place where Georgians have been coming for over a century. During Soviet times, this was the third most visited park in the entire Soviet Union. Third. After Moscow's Gorky Park.

It's history. It's memory. It's spirituality and cotton candy and roller coasters all mixed together. And somehow, somehow it works.

**Scene Notes:** Church exterior, pantheon views, historical plaques, mix of sacred and playful elements, locals visiting with families

### 5. Reflection & Call to Adventure (3:05-3:30)

I stayed until the park transformed into this illuminated wonderland. All these twinkling lights, the Ferris wheel glowing against the night sky, the city stretched out below like scattered diamonds.

And I thought about how wrong I was to almost skip this. How the best travel moments aren't always in the guidebook highlights. Sometimes they're on top of a holy mountain, in a century-old amusement park, watching a city you've fallen in love with light up beneath your feet.

Trust me on this one. Go. Just go.

**Scene Notes:** Park illuminated at night, lights reflecting on faces, final panoramic view of night-lit Tbilisi, Ferris wheel glowing, peaceful evening atmosphere
