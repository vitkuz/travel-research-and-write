## 🎬 Voiceover Script

### 1. The Approach (0:00-0:35)

Okay, so everyone told me—everyone—you can't visit Tbilisi without going to Narikala Fortress. The soul of the city, they said. Ancient citadel, fourth century, iconic views. I'm like, alright, let's do this.

I'm taking the cable car from Rike Park, and honestly? Honestly, this ride alone is insane. I'm suspended over the Mtkvari River, Old Town spreading out below me like some kind of living map. The fortress walls are getting closer, closer, and I'm thinking this is already worth it. Already.

**Scene Notes:** Cable car POV, city spreading below, fortress approaching

### 2. The First Surprise (0:35-1:15)

I get to the top and... there's a gate. With a sign. Closed for renovations until end of summer 2025. Closed. The main fortress—closed.

I'm standing here like, are you serious? I just came all the way up here and—but you know what though, you know what? The lower grounds are still open. St. Nicholas Church is accessible. And these views... holy shit, these views.

I can see the entire city from up here. Every red-tiled roof, every winding street, the river snaking through it all. The Mother Georgia statue is right there, sword in one hand, wine bowl in the other, like she's deciding whether to party or fight. And I get it now. I get why people come here even when the fortress is literally closed.

**Scene Notes:** Panoramic city views, Mother Georgia statue, weathered stone walls

### 3. The Layers Reveal (1:15-2:10)

So I'm walking around the accessible parts, touching these ancient limestone walls, and turns out—turns out—this fortress? Not even originally Georgian. It started Persian. Fourth century Persian stronghold on the Silk Road. Then the Arabs took it, used it as an astronomical observatory. Then the Mongols. That's actually where the name comes from—Mongol 'Naryn Kala,' Little Fortress.

The walls I'm seeing now? Mostly 16th, 17th century. And that Istanbul Tower over there, the one with no roof? Yeah, that was a prison during Turkish occupation.

But here's the wildest part. You wanna know why so much of this fortress is in ruins? Not war. Not invasion. Lightning. In 1827, lightning struck a Russian gunpowder storage building inside the fortress. Massive explosion. Like an earthquake. Just... boom. Gone.

I mean, come on. Survived Persians, Arabs, Mongols, Turks—and gets destroyed by weather and bad storage decisions.

**Scene Notes:** Ancient walls close-ups, ruined sections, Istanbul Tower

### 4. The Church That Isn't Ancient (2:10-2:45)

I walk into St. Nicholas Church and it's beautiful, right? Frescos everywhere, Biblical scenes, Georgian history painted on the walls. Feels ancient, feels sacred.

But then I find out—this church is from 1996. 1996. Less than 30 years old. The original 13th-century church burned down, and they just... rebuilt it. Completely rebuilt it after Georgian independence.

So this ancient fortress with its fourth-century foundations has a church that's younger than me. That's Tbilisi for you. Layers upon layers. Nothing is what it seems at first glance. Everything has a story behind the story.

**Scene Notes:** Church interior, frescos, contrast of new and old

### 5. The Descent and Reflection (2:45-3:30)

I'm taking the cable car back down as the sun starts setting, and the city is turning golden. All those rooftops, the sulfur bath domes, the botanical gardens spilling green down the hillside.

And here's the thing. Here's what I learned today. I came up here for an ancient fortress. Expected to walk through untouched history, you know? But what I got instead was better. I got the real story—the messy, complicated, rebuilt, destroyed, multilayered story of Tbilisi itself.

The fortress is closed. The church is new. The walls are from like five different empires. And somehow that makes it more honest, more real. This city doesn't pretend to be a museum. It's alive. Still changing, still rebuilding, still standing after everything that tried to knock it down.

Maybe that's what resilience actually looks like. Not untouched perfection. But patched-up survival.

Trust me on this—even when it's under renovation, even when you can't go inside, Narikala will surprise you. Just like this whole damn city.

**Scene Notes:** Cable car descent, sunset golden light over city, final wide shot of fortress silhouette
