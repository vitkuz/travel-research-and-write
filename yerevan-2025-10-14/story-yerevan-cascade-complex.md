# The Cascade Complex: Ascending Into Art

You face 572 steps carved into Yerevan's hillside, and suddenly the city's vertical ambition makes perfect sense. The Cascade rises 302 meters before you, a Soviet-era monument transformed into Armenia's most spectacular outdoor gallery. You step onto the first terrace, and there—Botero's voluptuous cat sculpture gleams in morning light, absurdly joyful against the white travertine.

The escalators inside offer an easy ascent, but you choose the outdoor stairs. With each terrace conquered, modern sculptures surprise you: a towering figure by Plensa, an angular piece by Chadwick. The stone reliefs embedded in the walls reveal Armenian khachkars, pomegranates, and ancient vines—Soviet grandeur embracing ancestral memory.

At the summit, breathless, you're rewarded with Yerevan sprawling below in shades of apricot and terracotta. Beyond the city's rooftops, Mount Ararat rises, snow-capped and impossible, floating above the horizon like a divine apparition. The Cafesjian Museum's 5,000 artworks live within this monumental staircase, all free to explore, but this view—this convergence of art, architecture, and mountain—is the masterpiece. You descended into Yerevan this morning; now you've ascended into understanding.
