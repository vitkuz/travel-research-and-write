# Erebuni Fortress: Where Yerevan Was Born

You stand atop Arin Berd hill reading the cuneiform inscription that changed everything: "By the greatness of Khaldi, Argishti, son of Menua, built this mighty fortress and proclaimed it Erebuni." The year was 782 BCE—2,806 years ago. Beneath your fingers, the stone still speaks in the Urartian language, announcing this city's birth.

The ruins spread around you: foundation walls of King Argishti's palace, the royal assembly hall where decisions rippled across the Ararat Valley, temple remains where priests made offerings to Khaldi, the Urartian god of sun and war. What began as military fortress evolved into thriving city, then—through Persian, Greek, Roman, Arab, Turkish, and Russian rule—into modern Yerevan. The name itself survived: Erebuni became Ereban, Ereban became Yerevan.

Inside the museum at the hill's base, 12,758 artifacts tell the story: pottery vessels still bearing grain residue, bronze belt buckles, silver coins, helmets dented by ancient blows. A farmer's plow strike in 1950 unearthed that first inscription tablet, and systematic excavations revealed over 100 rooms.

You gaze across modern Yerevan sprawling below—apartments, churches, Soviet monuments, glass towers—all rooted in this hilltop where Armenia's capital drew its first breath 28 centuries ago.
