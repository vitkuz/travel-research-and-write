# Tsitsernakaberd: Remembering the Unremembered

The taxi climbs toward Tsitsernakaberd—the Fortress of Swallows—and suddenly you're standing before twelve stone slabs arranged in a circle, leaning inward like mourners frozen in perpetual grief. At their center, fifteen meters below ground level, an eternal flame burns. The depth is deliberate: 1.5 meters for the 1.5 million who never returned.

You walk the 100-meter memorial wall, your fingers tracing town names carved in stone: Erzurum, Van, Bitlis, Kars. Places where entire Armenian communities were erased in 1915. The 44-meter column pierces the sky nearby—split but reaching upward, symbolizing both rupture and rebirth.

Inside the museum built into the hillside, photographs stare back: families in traditional dress, thriving Armenian quarters in Ottoman cities, children who would never grow old. Documentary evidence of systematic extermination meticulously preserved. Outside, Yerevan sprawls in the distance, vibrant and defiant—a capital that shouldn't exist according to the genocide's architects.

An Armenian grandmother places fresh flowers by the flame, her hands trembling. Every April 24th, thousands gather here, transforming trauma into memory, memory into resilience. You leave changed, carrying the weight of witness.
