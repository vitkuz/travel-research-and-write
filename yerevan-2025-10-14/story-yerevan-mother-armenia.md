# Mother Armenia: Guardian of the Capital

She towers 51 meters above Victory Park, sword sheathed, shield at her feet—a copper warrior who replaced Stalin's statue in 1967. You climb toward Mother Armenia as Yerevan spreads below in every direction, the city radiating outward like a living organism.

The statue's face is stern yet protective, gazing across her capital with unwavering vigilance. Architect Ara Harutyunyan designed her to embody peace through strength, and standing in her shadow, you feel both. The granite pedestal beneath her feet houses the Military Museum, where Armenia's World War II history lives in uniforms, medals, and fading photographs of soldiers who never returned.

From this vantage point, Mount Ararat dominates the horizon, Armenia's sacred mountain now across a closed border in Turkey—a painful irony not lost on anyone here. Victory Park stretches around you with walking paths and Soviet-era monuments, but it's the view that captivates: Yerevan in shades of pink tuff and terracotta roofs, the Hrazdan Gorge cutting through the landscape, the Cascade gleaming white in the distance.

Mother Armenia doesn't face Ararat. She watches over her children instead, eternal guardian of the city that survived everything.
