# Northern Avenue: Where Yerevan's Present Walks

You step onto Northern Avenue where Alexander Tamanyan's century-old vision finally materialized in 2007. This 450-meter pedestrian boulevard connects past and future: Republic Square's Soviet grandeur at one end, Freedom Square's modern energy at the other. Pink tuff and travertine facades rise on either side, housing Burberry and Armani beside Armenian boutiques.

A street musician strums a tar, its Middle Eastern melodies competing with the espresso machine hiss from Jazzve cafe. Couples stroll past, teenage girls clutching Massimo Dutti bags while elderly men in flat caps occupy benches, observing the parade of contemporary Armenian life with bemused approval.

You descend into the underground Tashir Street Shopping Gallery—a gleaming mall that feels transplanted from Dubai or Milan. Above ground again, a mime performs near the KFC, his white-painted face expressionless as children shriek with delight. The juxtaposition is pure Yerevan: ancient culture meeting aggressive modernization, neither quite winning.

As evening arrives, the avenue transforms. Restaurants fill with laughter and wine, the tuff buildings glow under strategic lighting, and Northern Avenue becomes a catwalk where Yerevan's young and restless showcase their cosmopolitan aspirations. The city is walking forward, and you're walking with it.
