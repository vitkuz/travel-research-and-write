# Parajanov Museum: The Beautiful Rebellion

You enter Sergei Parajanov's universe in Dzoragyugh, and immediately conventional reality fractures. The museum houses 1,400 pieces by the Soviet-Armenian filmmaker who transformed suffering into surreal beauty—and here, crammed into intimate rooms, his eccentric genius explodes across every surface.

Collages assault your senses: fragments of lace, medieval imagery, Orthodox icons, and Persian miniatures colliding in compositions that shouldn't work but mesmerize. His assemblages defy categorization—dolls constructed from found objects, hats that are sculptures, drawings that blur the line between sacred and profane. This is the visual language of "The Color of Pomegranates," his 1969 masterpiece that made Armenian cinema legendary.

Then you reach the prison art. Parajanov spent five years imprisoned by Soviet authorities for his sexuality and artistic defiance. Behind bars, denied proper materials, he created extraordinary works from bread, foil, and smuggled scraps. The aluminium coins he hammered now serve as prizes at Yerevan's Golden Apricot Film Festival—persecution transmuted into honor.

Standing before his unpublished screenplays and librettos, you understand: Parajanov refused to let ideology crush imagination. His museum isn't just memorial—it's continued rebellion, proving beauty survives everything, even systematic erasure. You leave seeing Yerevan through kaleidoscope eyes.
